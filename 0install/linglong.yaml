    cross-distribution packaging system
    Zero Install is a decentralised cross-distribution software installation
    system available under the LGPL. It allows software developers to publish
    programs directly from their own web-sites, while supporting features familiar
    from centralised distribution repositories such as shared libraries, automatic
    updates and digital signatures. It is intended to complement, rather than
    replace, the operating system's package management. 0install packages never
    interfere with those provided by the distribution.

    This package includes the GTK GUI for 0install. If you have a headless system,
    install just the 0install-core package to avoid pulling in any GUI
    dependencies.
