    Slide and add puzzle game for text mode
    The 2048 game is a mathematics based puzzle game where you have to
    slide tiles in a 4x4 board in any of the four possible directions.
    Touching tiles with the same value are then merged into tiles with the
    added value of the merged ones. You start with a couple of 2-valued
    tiles and new tiles appear randomly after sliding. The target of the
    game is to reach a tile with a value of 2048 before the board is full.
