    four-pane detailed-list file manager
    4pane is a dual twin-pane file manager: directories and files are displayed
    in separate panes. By default two pairs of these twin-panes are displayed at
    a time, allowing easy dragging or pasting.

    As well as standard file manager functions, features include support for
    nfs sshfs and samba, archive management including virtual browsing,
    multiple renaming of files, user-defined tools, a terminal emulator, and
    gui access to grep find and locate. Almost all actions, even deletions,
    can be undone and redone.

    4pane aims to be highly configurable, fast and fully-featured without bloat.
