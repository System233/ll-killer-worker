    Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries - real-time strategy game
    Seven Kingdoms, designed by Trevor Chan, brings a unique blend of real-time
    strategy with the addition of trade, diplomacy, and espionage.

    The game enables players to compete against up to six other kingdoms allowing
    players to conquer opponents by defeating them in war (with troops or
    machines), capturing their buildings with spies, or offering opponents money
    for their kingdom.

    In 2009, Enlight Software released the game under the GPL license.  7kfans
    project is updating the game and provides a community for fans.  A free Seven
    Kingdoms will help continue the legacy.
