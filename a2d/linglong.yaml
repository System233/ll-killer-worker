    APRS to DAPNET portal
    This portal serves as a bridge between the APRS
    Automatic Packet Reporting System and the DAPNET
    Decentralized Amateur Paging Network platform. It
    allows APRS users to relay their APRS messages and
    alerts to their DAPNET pager. This integration
    enables seamless communication between two distinct
    radio communication systems, enhancing the reach and
    accessibility of critical information for
    amateur radio enthusiasts.
