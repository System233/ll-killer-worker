    graphical ALSA sequencer connection manager
    aconnectgui is a graphical utility to connect and disconnect two existing
    ports on ALSA sequencer system. The ports with the arbitrary subscription
    permission, such as created by aseqview, can be connected to any (MIDI) device
    ports.

    aconnectgui is a frontend for aconnect, written directly on top of the
    aconnect source, leaving the original source intact, only adding a couple of
    ifdefs, and some calls to the gui part. It provides exactly the same
    functionality, but with a graphical user interface.
