    wrapper to make Firefox aware of Plasma Desktop activities
    Using activity-aware-firefox you can have Firefox windows in each Plasma
    Activity bound to that Activity.

    What activity-aware-firefox does is to create a Firefox Profile the first time
    it is run in an Activity, using its unique ID.

    Then every next time you run activity-aware-firefox in that Plasma Activity,
    it will start the Firefox Profile associated with it.
