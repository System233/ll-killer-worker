    advanced subtitle editor
    Originally created as tool to make typesetting, particularly in anime
    fansubs, a less painful experience, Aegisub has grown into a fully
    fledged, highly customizable subtitle editor.

    It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with timing, typesetting,
    editing and translating subtitles, as well as a powerful scripting environment
    called Automation (originally mostly intended for creating karaoke effects,
    Automation can now be used much else, including creating macros and various
    other convenient tools).
