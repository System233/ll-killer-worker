    Synthesised pipe organ emulator
    Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that
    should be good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a
    software synthesiser optimised for this job, with possibly hundreds
    of controls for each stop, that enable the user to "voice" his
    instrument.

    Main features of the default instrument: three manuals and one pedal,
    five different temperaments, variable tuning, MIDI control of course,
    stereo, surround or Ambisonics output, flexible audio controls
    including a large church reverb.

    Aeolus is not very CPU-hungry, and should run without problems on a
    e.g. a 1GHz, 256Mb machine.
