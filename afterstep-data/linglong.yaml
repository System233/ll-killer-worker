    data files for AfterStep window manager
    AfterStep is a window manager based on FVWM which attempts to emulate
    the NEXTSTEP look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
    predecessor.  Note that this window manager makes extensive use of the
    color palette.  If you have only an 8-bit color display, it will run
    as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
    colors.

    The package contains data and configuration files needed by AfterStep.
