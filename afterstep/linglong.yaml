    window manager with the NEXTSTEP look and feel
    AfterStep is a window manager based on FVWM which attempts to emulate
    the NEXTSTEP look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
    predecessor.  Note that this window manager makes extensive use of the
    color palette.  If you have only an 8-bit color display, it will run
    as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
    colors.

    AfterStep is a continuation of the BowMan window manager project, but
    the name was changed to reflect the desire that it do more than
    simply emulate and become a valuable window manager in its own right.
