    RSS/Atom feed aggregator
    Akregator is a news feed reader. It enables you to follow
    news sites, blogs and other RSS/Atom-enabled websites without the need to
    manually check for updates using a web browser. Akregator is designed to be
    both easy to use and to be powerful enough to read hundreds of news sources
    conveniently. It comes with Konqueror integration for adding news feeds and
    with an internal browser for easy news reading.

    This package is part of the KDE PIM module.
