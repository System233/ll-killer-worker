    Fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator
    Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
    allows for extensive configuration. By integrating with other applications,
    rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a
    flexible set of features with high performance.
