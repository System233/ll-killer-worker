    Interactive sky atlas for astronomical images and datasets
    Aladin is an interactive software sky atlas allowing the user to
    visualise digitised astronomical images, to superimpose entries from
    astronomical catalogues or databases, and to interactively access
    related data and information from the Simbad database, the VizieR
    service and other archives for all known sources in the field.

    Created in 1999 by the Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg
    (CDS), Aladin has become a widely-used tool of the Virtual
    Observatory (VO) framework capable of addressing challenges such as
    locating data of interest, accessing and exploring distributed
    datasets, and visualising multi-wavelength data. Compliance with
    existing or emerging VO standards, interconnection with other
    visualisation or analysis tools, and the ability to easily compare
    heterogeneous data are the key topics which allow Aladin to be a
    powerful data exploration and integration tool.
