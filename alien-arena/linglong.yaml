    ALIEN ARENA is a standalone 3D first person online death-match shooter crafted
    from the original source code of Quake II and Quake III, released by id
    Software under the GPL license. With features including 32-bit graphics, a new
    particle engine and effects, light blooms, reflective water, hi-resolution
    textures and skins, and hi-poly models and stain maps, ALIEN ARENA pushes the
    envelope of graphical beauty rivaling today's top games.

    This package installs the SDL client for Alien Arena.
