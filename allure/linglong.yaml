    near-future Sci-Fi roguelike and tactical squad game
    Allure of the Stars is a near-future Sci-Fi roguelike and tactical
    squad game.

    Not a single picture in this game. You have to imagine everything
    yourself, like with a book (a grown-up book, without pictures).
    Once you learn to imagine things, though, you can keep exploring
    and mastering the world and making up stories for a long time.

    The game is written in Haskell using the free software LambdaHack engine.
    Please see the changelog file for recent improvements
    and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long term goals
    are high replayability and auto-balancing through procedural
    content generation and persistent content modification
    based on player behaviour. Contributions are welcome.
