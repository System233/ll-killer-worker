    graphical soundcard mixer for ALSA soundcard driver
    alsamixergui is an FLTK based mixer program for use with the ALSA soundcard
    drivers. It supports multiple soundcards with multiple devices.

    alsamixergui is a frontend for alsamixer, written directly on top of the
    alsamixer source, leaving the original source intact, only adding a couple of
    ifdefs, and some calls to the gui part. It provides exactly the same
    functionality, but with a graphical user interface.
