    audio player (common files)
    Alsaplayer is a PCM player designed specifically for use with ALSA, but
    works great with OSS or EsounD. It's heavily threaded which cuts down on
    skipping, offers optional and even simultaneous visual scopes, plays
    mp3, mp2, ogg, cdda, audiofs, and lots more.

    This package contains the main alsaplayer program, and needs one interface
    plugin and one output plugin. By default, GTK+ interface and alsa output will
    be installed.
