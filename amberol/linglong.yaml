    Small and simple music player for GNOME
    Amberol is a music player aspiring to be as small, unintrusive, and simple as
    possible. It does not manage music collections, nor does it let you manage
    playlists, edit song metadata, show song lyrics or the band's Wikipedia page.
    Amberol plays music, and nothing else.

    It is well integrated into GNOME and features an adaptive UI for use on mobile
    devices.
