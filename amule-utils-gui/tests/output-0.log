./src/common/sizer.cpp(1624): assert "CheckSizerFlags ( !(flags & (wxALIGN_BOTTOM | wxALIGN_CENTRE_VERTICAL)) || !(flags & (wxALIGN_RIGHT | wxALIGN_CENTRE_HORIZONTAL)) )" failed in DoInsert(): wxEXPAND flag will be overridden by alignment flags

DO NOT PANIC !!

If you're an end user running a program not developed by you, please ignore this message, it is harmless, and please try reporting the problem to the program developers.

You may also set WXSUPPRESS_SIZER_FLAGS_CHECK environment variable to suppress all such checks when running this program.

If you're the developer, simply remove either wxEXPAND or the alignment in at least one direction from your code to avoid getting this message. You can also call wxSizerFlags::DisableConsistencyChecks() to globally disable all such checks, but this is strongly not recommended.
