    client for the eD2k and Kad networks, like eMule
    aMule is a peer-to-peer file sharing application, designed to connect
    to the eDonkey and Kad networks. It has a wide range of features,
    including many of the original eMule client, like:

    * online signature, source exchange, compressed transfers, secure
    identification, and IP filter support
    * boolean search, which can be local, global, or in the Kad network
    * checks against aggressive clients
    * slot allocation, to decide the number of remote clients
    * systray works well both in GNOME and KDE
    * translations to many languages

    A daemonized version of the application that does not need a graphic
    environment to run is available in the amule-daemon package, and
    various utilities of interest can be found in the amule-utils and
    amule-utils-gui packages, including the ed2k link handler.
