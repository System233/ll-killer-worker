    Game data for angband
    Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
    from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
    often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
    the game is still quite similar to Rogue (though there are now graphical
    tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or
    less continuous development since the early 1990s.

    This package contains the data files for the game.
