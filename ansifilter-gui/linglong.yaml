    parse common (terminal) ANSI codes and remove or convert them (GUI)
    ANSI codes are commands embedded in a text stream to add formatting
    instructions into text. These codes are interpreted by terminal emulators like
    xterm or Putty.

    ANSIFilter parses common ANSI codes to remove them or to convert them to
    another colored text file format (HTML, TeX, LaTeX, RTF, Pango or BBCode).
    Support for ANSI art files (based on codepage 437 and ANSI.SYS sequences or BIN
    /XBIN/TND files) is enabled with the --art-cp437, --art-bin and --art-tundra
    options.

    This package provides a GUI application.
