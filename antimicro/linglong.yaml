    GUI for mapping keyboard keys and mouse controls to a gamepad
    AntiMicroX is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse
    controls to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games
    using a gamepad that do not have any form of built-in gamepad support.
    However, you can use this program to control any desktop application
    (while running an X11 environment) with a gamepad.

    https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles is a repository for
    pre-made AntiMicroX profiles, providing convenience controller layouts
    suitable for playing a game without having to map everything yourself.

    Use evtest, or perhaps jstest from the joystick package, if you
    encounter problems detecting a controller, axes or buttons.
