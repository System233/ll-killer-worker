    Find RFI in radio astronomical observations
    The AOFlagger is a tool that can find and remove radio-frequency interference
    (RFI) in radio astronomical observations. The code has been highly optimized
    for speed and accuracy. It is used by default for the LOFAR radio telescope
    and thus is in productional stage. The software can run in a fully automated
    way, but a graphical interface is provided to analyse results and tweak the
    strategy. The preferred input file format is the Casa Measurement Set (MS)
    format.

    Besides the flagger, the software consists of tools to efficiently visualize
    data in different ways, such as plotting time-frequency diagrams and power
    spectra. It provides the programs aoflagger, rfigui, aoqplot, aoquality and
    more.
