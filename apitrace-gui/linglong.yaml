    tools for debugging OpenGL applications and drivers - graphical frontend
    apitrace is a suite of tools for debugging OpenGL applications and drivers.
    It includes a tool to generate a trace of all the OpenGL calls an application
    makes and a tool for replaying these traces and inspecting the rendering and
    OpenGL state during the program's execution.

    This makes it useful for identifying the sources of graphical corruption in
    OpenGL applications.

    This package contains a graphical frontend for the apitrace tool, making it
    easy to trace applications and replay, compare, profile, and modify existing
    traces.
