    KDE package management tool using PackageKit
    PackageKit allows performing simple software management tasks over a DBus
    interface  e.g. refreshing the cache, updating, installing and removing
    software packages or searching for multimedia codecs and file handlers.

    This package provides a KDE package manager based on PackageKit,
    as well as package management support for the KDE desktop.
    It implements the PackageKit session API for KDE, which allows
    applications to easily install additional software (e.g. extensions),
    uninstall files and perform simple software status queries.
