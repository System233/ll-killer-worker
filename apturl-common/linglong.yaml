    install packages using the apt protocol - common data
    AptUrl is a simple graphical application that takes an URL (which follows the
    apt-protocol) as a command line option, parses it and carries out the
    operations that the URL describes (that is, it asks the user if he wants the
    indicated packages to be installed and if the answer is positive does so for
    him).

    This package contains the common data shared between the frontends.
