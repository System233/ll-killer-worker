    PDF viewer with Vim-like behaviour
    apvlv (Alf's PDF Viewer Like Vim) is a small and fast PDF viewer, that uses
    poppler for rendering. Its interface aims to users who like vim behaviour.
    For example opening a PDF file can be done with ':o filename'. apvlv can also
    work with tabs, so you can open multiple files at the same time in one
    program.
