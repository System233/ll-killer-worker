    phylogenetic sequence analysis suite - main program
    ARB is a graphical suite of tools for sequence database handling and data
    analysis. A central database of processed (aligned) sequences and any
    type of additional data linked to the sequence entries is structured
    according to phylogeny or other user-defined criteria.

    The ARB project (from the Latin "arbor", a tree) is a joint initiative of
    the Lehrstuhl für Mikrobiologie and the LRR of the Technische Universität
    München in 1992.
    Since 2014 the ARB project is continued by the Department of Molecular
    Ecology http://www.mpi-bremen.de/en/Department_of_Molecular_Ecology.html
    at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen in
    cooperation with Ribocon GmbH http://www.ribocon.com .
