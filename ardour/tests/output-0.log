WARNING: Your system has a limit for maximum amount of locked memory!
         This might cause Ardour to run out of memory before your system runs
         out of memory. You can view the memory limit with 'ulimit -l', and it
         is normally controlled by /etc/security/limits.conf

WARNING: Your system contains a suspect libglib-2.0. Your version might be built
         to use mutex locking atomic operations. This is a fallback solution to
         a more robust hardware supported atomicity. It might cause reduced 
         performance and/or deadlocks. Please contact your distribution support
         about this issue.
         Unfortunately this check is not 100% accurate, so this might not be
         the case with your system.
