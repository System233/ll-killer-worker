    AVR development board IDE from Arduino CC
    Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
    flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists,
    designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive
    objects or environments.

    This package will install the integrated development environment that
    allows for program writing, code verification, compiling, and uploading
    to the Arduino development board. Example code will also be installed.

    Some base AVR libraries will be provided by the depending additional
    package arduino-core-avr. More libraries can be installed within the IDE
    itself by calling the libarary manager. This requires a working internet
    access.
