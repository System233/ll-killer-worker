    Handy off-line thesaurus based on WordNet
    Artha is a off-line English thesaurus with distinct features like:
    * hot-key press word look-up (select text on any window and press
    a preset hot-key for look-up)
    * regular expressions based search (broaden search using wild-cards
    like *, ?, etc.)
    * passive desktop notifications (of word definitions for
    uninterrupted work-flow)
    * spelling suggestions (when the exact spelling is vague/not known)

    Once launched, it monitors for a preset hot-key combination. When
    some text is selected on any window and the hot-key is pressed, it
    pops-up with the word looked-up. Should the user prefer passive
    notifications, this can be done by enabling the notifications option.

    When the term looked for is vague/not known, then either the search
    can be broadened with the use of regular expressions (*, ?, etc.) in
    the search string or spelling suggestions when a term is incorrect.

    For regular expressions based search to work, wordnet-sense-index
    package is required.
