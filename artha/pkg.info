Description: Handy off-line thesaurus based on WordNet
 Artha is a off-line English thesaurus with distinct features like:
   * hot-key press word look-up (select text on any window and press
     a preset hot-key for look-up)
   * regular expressions based search (broaden search using wild-cards
     like *, ?, etc.)
   * passive desktop notifications (of word definitions for
     uninterrupted work-flow)
   * spelling suggestions (when the exact spelling is vague/not known)
 .
 Once launched, it monitors for a preset hot-key combination. When
 some text is selected on any window and the hot-key is pressed, it
 pops-up with the word looked-up. Should the user prefer passive
 notifications, this can be done by enabling the notifications option.
 .
 When the term looked for is vague/not known, then either the search
 can be broadened with the use of regular expressions (*, ?, etc.) in
 the search string or spelling suggestions when a term is incorrect.
 .
 For regular expressions based search to work, wordnet-sense-index
 package is required.
