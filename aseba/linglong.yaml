  description: |-
    Event-based framework for distributed mobile robots control
    Aseba's core is a lightweight virtual machine, small enough to run on
    any 16 bits microcontroller.  In Aseba, all virtual machines are
    linked in a network and all their programs are developed and debugged
    from a single application, Aseba Studio.

    Aseba allows one to program Thymio, a small robot to discover the
    universe of robotics and learn a robot's language.
