    surreal platform shooting game
    Young Sigmund has a few problems. To help him resolve his mental
    instability you must enter the surreal world of his inner mind and
    shut down the malfunctioning brain cells. Guide Sigmund through the
    Ego, Psyche and Id zones - each one 300 times the size of the screen -
    to locate the eight renegade neurons, entering them one by one to find
    and trigger their self-destruct system.

    This is a port of Digital Psychosis' 1994 game for the Acorn
    Archimedes.
