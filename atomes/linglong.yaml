  description: |-
    atomic-scale 3D modeling toolbox
    Atomes is a tool box to analyze (physico-chemical properties calculations),
    visualize (atoms, bonds, colormaps, measurements, coordination polyedra ...)
    create (crystal builder, molecular library, surface creation and
    passivation ...) 3D atomistic models.
    Atomes offers a workspace capable of handling many projects opened
    simultaneously.
    The different projects in the workspace can exchange data: analysis results,
    atomic coordinates...
    Atomes also provides an advanced input preparation system for further
    calculations using well known molecular dynamics codes:
    Classical MD: DLPOLY and LAMMPS
    - ab-initio MD: CPMD and CP2K
    - QM-MM MD: CPMD and CP2K
    To prepare the input files for these calculations is likely to be the key, and
    most complicated step towards MD simulations.
    Atomes offers a user-friendly assistant to help and guide the scientist step
    by step to achieve this crucial step.

    This package provides the binaries.
