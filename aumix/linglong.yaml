    Simple text-based mixer control program
    aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
    card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
    line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it
    can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
    boot.

    A wrapper script xaumix is provided that finds and invokes xterm or a
    replacement. This is primarily for creating the best sized terminal window.
