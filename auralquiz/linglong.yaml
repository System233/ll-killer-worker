    simple music quiz game using your own music files
    auralquiz is a music quiz game that scans a users selected folder of music
    and creates a quiz using the tags from the audio files.  A sample of a
    random song is played and the player must answer a question about the
    sample from either multiple choice buttons or for hardcore difficulty,
    type in the correct answer. Up to 8 players can play in a turn based
    mode with scoring based on points, with more points given by answering
    the question faster.
