    program to rename files to make them sort in given order
    This is a simple graphical program that lets you reorder the files using
    drag-and-drop and then changes the names of the files such that their
    alphabetical sorting matches the ordering you chose. You can also shuffle
    the files.

    Currently the renaming consists of prepending each filename with a short
    number.

    The program displays thumbnails of files using GNOME libraries.
