    Avahi GTK+ utilities
    Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
    It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
    running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
    example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
    print to, files to look at and people to talk to.

    This package contains some small GTK+ utilities to discover ssh and vnc
    servers.
