    Molecular Graphics and Modelling System
    Avogadro is a molecular graphics and modelling system targeted at molecules
    and biomolecules.  It can visualize properties like molecular orbitals or
    electrostatic potentials and features an intuitive molecular builder.

    Features include:
    * Molecular modeller with automatic force-field based geometry optimization
    * Molecular Mechanics including constraints and conformer searches
    * Visualization of molecular orbitals and general isosurfaces
    * Visualization of vibrations and plotting of vibrational spectra
    * Support for crystallographic unit cells
    * Input generation for the Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO quantum chemistry
    packages
    * Flexible plugin architecture and Python scripting

    File formats Avogadro can read include PDB, XYZ, CML, CIF, Molden, as well as
    Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO output.
