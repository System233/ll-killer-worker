    simple backup/snapshot system (graphical interface)
    Back In Time is a framework for rsync and cron for the purpose of
    taking snapshots and backups of specified folders. It minimizes disk space use
    by taking a snapshot only if the directory has been changed, and hard links
    for unmodified files if it has. The user can schedule regular backups using
    cron.

    This is the graphical interface for Back In Time.
