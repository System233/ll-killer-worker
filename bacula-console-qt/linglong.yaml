    network backup service - Bacula Administration Tool
    Bacula is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery and verification of
    data across a network of computers of different kinds.

    The management console allows the administrator or user to
    communicate with the Bacula Director.

    This package provides the most advanced GUI to Bacula: the Bacula
    Administration Tool (BAT) console.

    This GUI interface has been designed to ease restore operations as much as
    possible as compared to the basic text console.
