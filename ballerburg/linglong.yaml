    Classical castle combat game
    Two castles, separated by a mountain, try to defeat each other with their
    cannonballs, either by killing the opponent's king or by weakening the
    opponent enough so that the king capitulates.

    Ballerburg was originally written 1987 by Eckhard Kruse, for the Atari ST
    machines (which were brand new computers at that point in time). Over 25
    years later, here's finally the adaption of the original source code to
    modern operating systems.
