  description: |-
    free molecular modeling and molecular graphics tool
    BALLView provides fast OpenGL-based visualization of molecular structures,
    molecular mechanics methods (minimization, MD simulation using the
    AMBER, CHARMM, and MMFF94 force fields), calculation and visualization
    of electrostatic properties (FDPB) and molecular editing features.

    BALLView can be considered a graphical user interface on the basis of
    BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) with a focus on the most common
    demands of protein chemists and biophysicists in particular.  It is
    developed in the groups of Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland University,
    Saarbruecken, Germany) and Oliver Kohlbacher (University of Tuebingen,
    Germany). BALL is an application framework in C++ that has been
    specifically designed for rapid software development in Molecular
    Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology.  It provides an extensive
    set of data structures as well as classes for Molecular Mechanics,
    advanced solvation methods, comparison and analysis of protein
    structures, file import/export, and visualization.
