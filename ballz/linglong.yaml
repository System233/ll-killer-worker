    B.A.L.L.Z. - platform/puzzle game where you control a rolling ball
    The game is a platformer with some puzzle elements. You take control
    of a ball which is genetically modified by the British secret
    service. Your mission is to rescue captured British soldiers from a
    prison in Iran.

    The game was written in 72 hours for the TINS competition, a
    competition similar to Speedhack. The name TINS is an recursive
    acronym for 'TINS is not Speedhack'.
