    keyboard mashing and doodling game for babies
    Bambam is a simple baby keyboard masher application that locks
    the keyboard and mouse and instead displays bright colors,
    pictures, and sounds.

    Note: for safety it is recommended to run the game in a dedicated login
    session, rather than as an application in your regular session, especially
    when leaving your child unattended with the game. Look for session type BamBam
    in your display manager login screen.
