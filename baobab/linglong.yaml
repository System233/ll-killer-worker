    GNOME disk usage analyzer
    Disk Usage Analyzer is a graphical, menu-driven application to analyse
    disk usage in a GNOME environment. It can easily scan either the whole
    filesystem tree, or a specific user-requested directory branch (local or
    remote).

    It also auto-detects in real-time any changes made to your home
    directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. Disk Usage Analyzer
    also provides a full graphical treemap window for each selected folder.
