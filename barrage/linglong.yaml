    Rather destructive action game
    Barrage is a rather destructive action game that puts you on a shooting
    range with the objective to hit as many dummy targets as possible
    within 3 minutes. You control a gun which may either fire small or large
    grenades at dummy soldiers, jeeps and tanks. The gameplay is simple but
    it is not that easy to get high scores.
