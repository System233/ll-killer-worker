    Share mouse, keyboard and clipboard over the network
    Barrier lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
    multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
    own display, without special hardware.  It's intended for users
    with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its
    own display.

    Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse
    off the edge of your screen.  Barrier also merges the clipboards of
    all the systems into one, allowing cut-and-paste between systems.
    Furthermore, it synchronizes screen savers so they all start and stop
    together and, if screen locking is enabled, only one screen requires
    a password to unlock them all.
