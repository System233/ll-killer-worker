    educational BASIC programming environment for children
    BASIC-256 is an easy to use version of BASIC designed to teach young
    children the basics of computer programming. It uses traditional
    control structures like gosub, for/next, and goto, which helps kids
    easily see how program flow-control works. It has a built-in graphics
    mode which lets them draw pictures on screen in minutes, and a set
    of detailed, easy-to-follow tutorials that introduce programming
    concepts through fun exercises.
