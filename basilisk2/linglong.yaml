    68k Macintosh emulator
    Basilisk II is an Open Source 68k Macintosh emulator. That is, it enables
    you to run 68k MacOS software on you computer, even if you are using a
    different operating system. However, you still need a copy of MacOS and
    a Macintosh ROM image to use Basilisk II.

    Some features of Basilisk II:
    - Emulates either a Mac Classic (which runs MacOS 0.x thru 7.5)
    or a Mac II series machine (which runs MacOS 7.x, 8.0 and 8.1),
    depending on the ROM being used
    - Color video display
    - CD quality sound output
    - Floppy disk driver (only 1.44MB disks supported)
    - Driver for HFS partitions and hardfiles
    - CD-ROM driver with basic audio functions
    - Easy file exchange with the host OS via a "Host Directory Tree" icon
    on the Mac desktop
    - Ethernet driver
    - Serial drivers
    - SCSI Manager (old-style) emulation
    - Emulates extended ADB keyboard and 3-button mouse
    - Uses UAE 68k emulation or (under AmigaOS and NetBSD/m68k) real 68k
    processor
