    ncurses Tetris clone with a bastard algorithm
    Bastet ("bastard Tetris") is a free clone of Tetris which tries to
    compute how useful blocks are and gives you the worst possible brick.
    Playing bastet can be a painful experience, especially if you usually
    make "canyons" and wait for the long I-shaped block.
