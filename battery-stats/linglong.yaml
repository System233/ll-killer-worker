    collects statistics about charge of laptop batteries
    This package provides battery-stats-collector, a daemon which will periodically
    collect statistics about the charge of the batteries present.

    It also provides a binary called battery-graph, which can be used to generate
    qplot graphs about the battery charge/discharge patterns over time.

    Note: This requires APM or ACPI to be enabled and working in your kernel.
