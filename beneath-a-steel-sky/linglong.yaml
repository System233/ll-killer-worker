    A science-fiction thriller set in a bleak post-apocalyptic vision
    of the future, Beneath a Steel Sky revolves around "Union City",
    where selfishness, rivalry, and corruption by its citizens seems to
    be all too common, those who can afford it live underground, away
    from the pollution and social problems which are plaguing the city.

    You take on the role of Robert Foster, an outcast of sorts from the
    city since a boy who was raised in a remote environment outside of
    Union City simply termed "the gap".  Robert's mother took him away
    from Union City as a child on their way to "Hobart" but the helicopter
    crashed on its way, unfortunately Robert's mother dies, but he
    survives and is left to be raised by a local tribe from the gap.

    Years later, Union City security drops by and abducts Robert, killing
    his tribe in the process; upon reaching the city the helicopter taking
    him there crashes with him escaping, high upon a tower block in the
    middle of the city he sets out to discover the truth about his past,
    and to seek vengeance for the killing of his tribe.
