    Logic game based on Sokoban
    Berusky is a free logic game based on an ancient puzzle named Sokoban.  An old
    idea of moving boxes in a maze has been expanded with new logic items such as
    explosives, stones, special gates and so on. In addition, up to five bugs can
    cooperate and be controlled by the player.  In order to leave each level
    (there's about 120 levels in the game) it is necessary to own five keys and
    also to have a free way to the exit.
