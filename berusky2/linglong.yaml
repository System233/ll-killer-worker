    logic game Bugs Escape 3D
    The game based on Berusky that is also available for Debian, though this is
    the enhanced 3D version. Berusky II is a game that challenges your
    visual/spatial thinking and the ability to find a way to resolve a logic task.

    The entire game takes place in a 3D environment while you slip into the role
    of different bugs and lead them out of a maze. In addition to arbitrary
    turning and level zooming all logical plots happen in space.

    In comparison to the first part, new logical elements, a simple linear story
    accompanied by comic series, various 3D environments, water surfaces and
    others have been added.
