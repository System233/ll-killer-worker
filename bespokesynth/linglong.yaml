    software modular synthesizer
    Bespoke is a software modular synthesizer. It contains an array of modules,
    which one can connect together to create sounds. Bespoke is like a digital
    audio workstation in some ways, but with less of a focus on a global timeline.
    Instead, it has a design more optimized for jamming and exploration.
