    game about consciousness and isolation
    Between is a pixelated art game for two players by Jason Rohrer.

    You know exactly what you need to do -- you can see it shimmering
    right there in front of you. You can see it while dreaming, too, and
    the difference has become subtle. Dreams wake into dreams, and people
    blend in and out: real characters and dream characters, all woven into
    the same script. Finally, they fade completely, and you're alone in the
    expanse with the construction. With time, you feel something growing,
    a pinhole that eventually yawns into a deep ravine of longing. The
    construction languishes, though the expanse seems indifferent.

    One night, in a dream, they appear: things that you clearly could not
    have conjured on your own. Not snowflakes. Not the self-similar forms
    of leaves. Not distant planets' erosion networks as viewed through
    telescopes. Not those things that are beautifully external but lack
    the signatures of consciousness. These things that appear are ugly and
    non-procedural: indecipherable transmissions bubbling up through static,
    faded messages floating in bottles, and charcoal handprints on cave
    walls. Evidence has reached you through time of unknown duration and
    distance of unknown magnitude, but stale evidence is still evidence.

    Somewhere, across whatever barriers stand between, is an "other".
