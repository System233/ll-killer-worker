    logic game with arcade and tactics modes
    Biniax-2 is an original and entertaining game. It only takes a minute to learn
    and gives you hours and hours of game play. There are three game modes (two
    single-player and one multi-player), a hall of fame, dynamic music and a nice
    cartoon look.
