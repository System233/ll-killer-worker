    WINE Is Not An Emulator - runs MS Windows programs
    Wine is a program which allows running Microsoft Windows programs
    (including DOS, Windows 3.x and Win32 executables) on Unix. It
    consists of a program loader which loads and executes a Microsoft
    Windows binary, and a library (called Winelib) that implements Windows
    API calls using their Unix or X11 equivalents.  The library may also
    be used for porting Win32 code into native Unix executables.
