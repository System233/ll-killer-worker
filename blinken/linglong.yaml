    KDE version of the Simon electronic memory game
    Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which
    challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length.  On
    the face of the device, there are 4 different color buttons, each
    with its own distinctive sound.  These buttons light up randomly,
    creating the sequence that the player must then recall.  If the
    player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the
    correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical
    sequence with one extra step is presented.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
