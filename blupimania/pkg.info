Description: A mind boggling (brain twisting) game of logic
 Blupi comes out of a hole holding on to a balloon. Unfortunately he
 let's it blow away. Blupi is lost, he turns to the left or the right
 and does various unpredictable things of his own. The object of the
 game is to help him find another balloon, so that he can move on to the
 next riddle.
