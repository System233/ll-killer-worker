    GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
    The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
    software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
    resources.

    This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
    control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
    overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
    * attached projects
    * running tasks
    * file transfers between the client and project servers
    * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
    * constraints on CPU usage
    The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
    it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
    in which all information and all control elements are available.

    For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
    boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
    machine contributing.
