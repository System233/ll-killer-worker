    free Bomberman clone
    BomberClone is a free Bomberman-like game for Linux and Windows. The rules of
    the game are simple: run through a level and bomb other players. It features
    powerups that give you more strength, make you walk faster through the level,
    or let you drop more bombs.

    BomberClone can be played in multi-player mode via IPv4 or IPv6 networks or in
    single-player mode against the local AI.
