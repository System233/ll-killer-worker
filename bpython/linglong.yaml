    fancy interface to the Python 3 interpreter
    bpython is a fancy interface to the Python interpreter, and has the
    following features:

    * In-line syntax highlighting.
    * Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type
    * Expected parameter list for any Python function. Uses pydoc to attempt to
    divine params for C functions.
    * "Rewind" function to pop the last line of code from memory and re-evaluate.
    Note: this is only really useful when laying out classes and functions,
    since a true "undo" function is impossible, so be careful when using this.
    * Send the code you've entered off to a pastebin and display the pastebin URL
    for copying, etc.
    * Save the code you've entered to a file.
    * Auto-indentation.
    * Anti-Crash Mode.

    This package contains bpython for Python 3.
