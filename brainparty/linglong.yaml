    36 puzzle games for all the family
    Brain Party is a fun, free puzzle game for all the family that's made
    up of 36 minigames designed to push your brain to its limits by testing
    memory, logic, mathematics, reaction time and more! Brain Party is
    split into two modes: test mode gives you five minigames in a row and
    adds up your brain weight to see how smart you are, and practise mode
    lets you play your favourite minigames as often as you want. If you do
    well enough, there are six extra minigames that can be unlocked as well
    as a new game mode designed to keep you playing and enjoying your
    favourite games even longer.
