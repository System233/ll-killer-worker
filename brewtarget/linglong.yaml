    GUI beer brewing software
    Brewtarget is a calculator for brewing beer. It is a Qt-based program which
    allows you to create recipes from a database of ingredients. It calculates all
    the important parameters, helps you with mash temperatures, and just makes the
    process of recipe formulation much easier.
