    fast paced 3d Breakout game
    Briquolo is a Breakout like game which takes place on a colourful 3d playing
    field. It features 23 fancy levels with moving bricks, great explosions and
    sounds, different camera perspectives and an editor to create your own
    custom levels.

    Briquolo uses OpenGL to offer modern graphical effects and is very portable
    thanks to the SDL library.
