Version 4.2, fall 1984.
First Adventure game written by His Lordship, the honorable
Admiral D.W. Riggle


	This is a luxurious stateroom.
The floor is carpeted with a soft animal fur and the great wooden furniture
is inlaid with strips of platinum and gold.  Electronic equipment built
into the walls and ceiling is flashing wildly.  The floor shudders and
the sounds of dull explosions rumble though the room.  From a window in
the wall ahead comes a view of darkest space.  There is a small adjoining
room behind you, and a doorway right.
