    GUI to find and choose locale characters
    This is part of a suite of python3 and Vala based applets & mini-apps
    created for the Budgie Desktop that provide additional user orientated
    capabilities. These can be used individually or as a set.

    Quickly find and choose the equivalent locale character for an ascii
    character.

    Quickchar can be used on most desktop environments invoked by a shortcut key.
