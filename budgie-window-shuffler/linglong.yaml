    Keyboard and GUI friendly window-tiling capability
    Budgie-Desktop is a GTK+ based desktop environment which focuses on
    simplicity and elegance.  It provides a traditional desktop metaphor
    based interface utilising customisable panel based menu driven system.
    Budgie-Desktop is written from scratch utilising many GNOME based
    sub-systems such as GNOME-Session and Mutter.

    The window shuffler is an easy to use windows tiling capability
    driven primarily through the keyboard to place and move window in
    a grid format.

    Windows can be easily quarter, half-tiled & maximized. Windows can
    be moved within a user defined grid and intelligently switches
    window positions where necessary.
