    Bugs are trying to suck blood out of your arm!
    "Bug Squish" is an action game not unlike light gun arcade games, but
    played with a mouse.  It's loosely based on a MacOS game whose name Bill
    can't recall.

    Bugs are trying to suck blood out of your arm!  Squish them with
    your fly swatter before you run out of blood.
