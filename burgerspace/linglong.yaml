    Avoid evil foodstuffs and make burgers
    This is a clone of the classic game "BurgerTime". In it, you play the
    part of a chef who must create burgers by stepping repeatedly on the
    ingredients until they fall into place. And to make things more
    complicated, you also must avoid evil animate food items while performing
    this task, with nothing but your trusty pepper shaker to protect you.
