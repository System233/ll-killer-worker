    D-Bus activity visualiser
    Bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of D-Bus
    calls for profiling and debugging purposes. It is intended to replace
    reading the cryptic output of dbus-monitor.

    Calls are displayed using Message Sequence Charts, a succinct way of
    representing entities and interactions over time. It can also output
    data in Graphviz format.

    This package contains the graphical visualizer for traces generated
    with the bustle-pcap tool in the bustle-pcap package.
