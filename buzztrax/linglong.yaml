    Modular music composer
    Buzztrax aims to be a music studio that allows one to compose songs using
    only a computer with a soundcard. If youâ€™ve used tracker programs like
    FastTracker, Impulse Tracker, or the original AMIGA SoundTracker, that will
    give you an idea of how one can sequence music in Buzztrax. The Buzztrax
    editor uses a similar concept, where a song consists of a sequence with
    tracks and in each track one uses patterns with events (musical notes and
    control changes). In contrast to other Tracker programs, tracks are not
    simply sample players: a user can make a song using an arrangement of virtual
    audio plugins that are linked together to create different effects. Each of
    these machines can be controlled realtime or via patterns in the sequencer.
