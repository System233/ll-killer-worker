    Empire Building Game (GTK2), C-evo: Distant Horizon
    A civilization style, turn based strategy game, of the Civ II era.

    With a time scope of several thousand years, it covers aspects of exploration
    and expansion, industry and agriculture, warfare and diplomacy, science and
    administration. C-evo follows the spirit of popular turn-based strategy games
    from the mid 90s, but with more emphasis on powerful AI and careful design
    of the rules, resulting in a true challenge.
