  description: |-
    field-theory motivated computer algebra system
    This is a computer algebra system designed specifically for the
    solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive
    functionality for tensor polynomial simplification including
    multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables,
    Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate
    dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input format is
    a subset of TeX.
