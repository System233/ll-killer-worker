    prevent the desktop becoming idle in full-screen mode
    Caffeine prevents the desktop from becoming idle when an application
    is running full-screen. A desktop indicator ‘caffeine-indicator’
    supplies a manual toggle, and the command ‘caffeinate’ can be used
    to prevent idleness for the duration of any command.
