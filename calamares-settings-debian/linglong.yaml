    Debian theme and settings for the Calamares Installer
    Calamares is a generic installer framework for Linux distributions.
    By default, it contains a set of boilerplate wording and images. This
    package provides the latest Debian artwork as well as scripts that
    supports EFI installations.

    It also serves as an example for how derivatives can create their own
    calamares-settings packages.
