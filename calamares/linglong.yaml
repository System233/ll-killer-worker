    distribution-independent installer framework
    Calamares is a distribution-independent installer framework.

    It provides a graphical installer that can be used with nearly
    any distribution. This package is suitable for live media on
    Debian-based systems, and won't be of any particular use on
    an already installed system.

    You will likely want to provide your own config files to match
    your distribution, reading the Calamares documentation will guide
    you through that process.
