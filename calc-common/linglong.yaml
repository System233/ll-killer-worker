    Arbitrary precision calculator (common files)
    Calc is an arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like
    language. Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper and as a
    mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one with a
    machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of
    builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.

    This package contains architecture independent files required by the main
    package `calc'.
