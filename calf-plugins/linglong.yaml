    Calf Studio Gear - audio effects and sound generators
    The Calf plugins include all todays frequently used studio effects
    along with some feature-rich sound processors.

    Calf Studiogear is designed to run under the most flexible plugin
    standard in Linux, namely LV2. So you're able to insert them in lots of
    plugin-capable audio software like Ardour, Rosegarden and others.

    The Calf Rack offers you all Calf effects and synthesizers in an
    easy-to-use studio rack. Wire the effects through Jack to build your own
    studio environment and trigger the sound processors live or through a
    MIDI sequencer or tracker.
