    presentation program for the Calligra Suite
    Stage is an easy to use yet still flexible presentation application. You can
    easily create presentations containing a rich variety of elements, from
    graphics to text, from charts to images. Stage is extensible through a
    plugin system, so it is easy to add new effects, new content elements or even
    new ways of managing your presentation.

    Stage natively uses the OpenDocument file format standard, for easy
    interchange with all ODF supporting applications, which includes Microsoft
    Office. Examples of its easy-to-use features are support for layouts, a
    special slide overview view during presentations for the presenter, support
    for many different master sliders in one presentation, cool transitions and
    a useful notes feature.

    This package is part of the Calligra Suite.
