    pipeline replay application for the CamiTK library
    CamiTK helps researchers and clinicians to easily and rapidly collaborate in
    order to prototype CAMI applications, that feature medical images,
    surgical navigation and biomechanical simulations.

    camitk-actionstatemachine is able to replay a pipeline (workflow) of CamiTK
    actions.
    This application takes an CamiTK augmented version of a SCXML subset as input
    and allow on to replay interactive the described state-machine containing a
    list of CamiTK actions and transitions.
