    workbench application for the CamiTK library
    CamiTK helps researchers and clinicians to easily and rapidly collaborate in
    order to prototype CAMI applications, that feature medical images,
    surgical navigation and biomechanical simulations.

    camitk-imp is the CamiTK workbench application where you can test
    all available extensions for prototyping.
    It provides an easy and interactive access to all available data and
    algorithm parameters, including the one you build yourself using
    the CamiTK SDK.

    For example, camitk-imp can visualize medical images from a lot of different
    (standard) formats, offers image processing and segmentation algorithms to
    reconstruct a mesh geometry and run a biomechanical simulation.
