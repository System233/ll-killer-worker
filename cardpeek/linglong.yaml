    * EMV cards, including NFC ones
    * Navigo public transport cards (partially supports MOBIB as well)
    * The French health card "Vitale 2"
    * Electronic/Biometric passports in BAC security mode

    It can also read the following cards with limited interpretation of data:
    * Some Mifare cards (such as the Thalys card)
    * Moneo, the French electronic purse
    * GSM SIM cards
