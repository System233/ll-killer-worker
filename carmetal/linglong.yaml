  description: |-
    dynamic geometry software with highly ergonomic UI
    Based on the C.a.R. (Compass and Ruler) project, CaRMetal includes
    all of its functionalities - or almost. It propose a different approach
    from the graphical interface point of view.

    - Ruler and compass constructions can be changed by dragging one of the
    basic construction points. The construction follows immediately. The
    student can check the correctness of the construction and gain new
    insight.
    - Tracks of points and animated constructions can help to understand
    geometric relations. Tracks can be used as new objects to explore.
    - With the macros of C.a.R. very complicated constructions become
    possible. Macros are also a way to organize the geometric thinking.
    - Hiding construction details and using colors make constructions
    clearer to read. In C.a.R. lines and circles can also be reduced to the
    relevant points.
    - Arithmetic computations, numerical solutions, curves and functions
    go beyond classical constructions. It is even possible to construct in 3D
    using advanced macros.
    - Other geometries, hyperbolic or elliptic, can be explored.
    - Scripting (javascript based) of figures.
