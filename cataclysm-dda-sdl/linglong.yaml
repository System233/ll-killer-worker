    post-apocalyptic roguelike game - SDL interface
    Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world.

    While some have described it as a "zombie game", there's far more to Cataclysm
    than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated
    world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or,
    if you're lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of
    Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities,
    from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and
    deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...

    This package contains the graphical SDL2-based interface.
