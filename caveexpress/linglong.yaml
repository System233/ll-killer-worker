    2D platformer with physics-based gameplay
    CaveExpress is a classic 2D platformer with physics-based gameplay
    and dozens of levels. Master your pedal-powered flying machine to
    pick up packages from your cave-dwelling clients and drop them off
    at the collection point.

    But beware! Mighty mastodons, terrifying pterodactyls and others
    would rather see you extinct.
