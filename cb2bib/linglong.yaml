    extract bibliographic references from various sources
    cb2bib is a program to extract bibliographic references from
    unformatted and non standard sources, like:
    - email alerts;
    - journal Web pages;
    - and most interestingly PDF files.

    Output references are written to BibTeX-formatted files. Other
    features include:
    - article files can be linked and renamed by dragging them onto the
    cb2Bib window;
    - editing and browsing BibTeX files;
    - citing references, searching references and the full contents of the
    referenced documents;
    - inserting bibliographic metadata to documents;
    - writing short notes that interrelate several references.
