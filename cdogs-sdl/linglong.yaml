    classic overhead run-and-gun game
    C-Dogs SDL is an overhead shoot-em-up which lets players work alone and
    cooperatively during missions or fight against each other in the
    "dogfight" deathmatch mode.

    Customize your player, choose from many weapons, and blast, slide and
    slash your way through over 100 user-created campaigns.
