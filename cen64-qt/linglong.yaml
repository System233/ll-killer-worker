    Cross-platform graphical frontend for the CEN64 emulator
    CEN64-Qt is a cross-platform graphical frontend for the CEN64 emulator. Since
    CEN64 itself provides a simple command line interface only, anyone who wants
    to use this particular emulator with a little more convenience has to resort
    to additional software which is where this package jumps in.

    The frontend lists all available ROMs after adding them to the inventory with
    the option to download additional information from external game databases on
    the web. File paths for the necessary IPL files can be conveniently configured
    from the settings menu as well as the paths where games save a stored and
    recovered from.

    Additional features include a log viewer for the emulator, a configurable view
    for the ROM listing as well as a quick access menu to select the preferred
    input device for the emulator such as different gamepads and a keyboard.

    Naturally, all settings are automatically saved and restored such that they
    only need to be configured once.
