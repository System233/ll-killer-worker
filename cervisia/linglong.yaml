    graphical CVS client
    Cervisia is a front-end for the CVS version control system client.

    In addition to basic and advanced CVS operations, it provides a convenient
    graphical interface for viewing, editing, and manipulating files in a CVS
    repository or working directory.  It includes tools designed to ease the use
    of CVS, such as a log browser, conflict resolver, and changelog editor that
    checks for incorrect formatting.

    This package is part of the KDE Software Development Kit module.
