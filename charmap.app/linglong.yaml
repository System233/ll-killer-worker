    Character map for GNUstep
    This is a character map. It is developed using the GNUstep development
    environment (www.gnustep.org) and is meant to contribute to GNUstep's promise
    towards a desktop environment.

    Charmap offers font selection, allowing one to easily see all the
    glyphs which a particular font offers.
