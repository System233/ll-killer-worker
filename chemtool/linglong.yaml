    chemical structures drawing program
    Chemtool is a GTK+ based 2D chemical structure editor for X11. It
    supports many bond styles, most forms of text needed for chemical
    typesetting and splines/arcs/curved arrows.

    Drawings can be exported to MOL and PDB format, SVG or XFig format for
    further annotation, as a PiCTeX drawing, as a bitmap or as Postscript
    files (several of these through XFig's companion program fig2dev).

    The package also contains a helper program, cht, to calculate sum
    formula and (exact) molecular weight from a chemtool drawing file. Cht
    can either be called directly by Chemtool or on the console.
