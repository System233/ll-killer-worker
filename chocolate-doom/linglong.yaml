    Doom engines closely-compatible with Vanilla Doom
    Chocolate Doom aims to accurately reproduce the original DOS version of
    Doom and other games based on the Doom engine in a form that can be
    run on modern computers. Unlike most modern Doom engines, Chocolate Doom
    is not derived from the Boom source port and does not inherit its
    features (or bugs).

    This package contains:
    * Chocolate Doom, a port of Id Software's "Doom" (1993)
    * Chocolate Heretic, a port of Raven Software's "Heretic" (1994)
    * Chocolate Hexen, a port of Raven Software's "Hexen" (1995)
    * Chocolate Strife, a recreation of Rogue Entertainment's "Strife" (1996)

    These games are designed to behave as similar to the original DOS version as
    is possible.

    Chocolate Doom supports all flavors of Doom, including The Ultimate Doom, Doom
    2 and Final Doom as well as Chex(R) Quest, HacX, Freedoom: Phase 1 and Phase 2
    and FreeDM.

    All Chocolate game engines require game data to play. For Chocolate Doom,
    free game data is available in the freedoom package. Commercial game data for
    all four engines can be packaged using "game-data-packager".
