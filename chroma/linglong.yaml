    Abstract puzzle game - graphical version
    Chroma is an abstract puzzle game. A variety of colourful shapes are
    arranged in a series of increasingly complex patterns, forming
    fiendish traps that must be disarmed and mysterious puzzles that must
    be manipulated in order to give up their subtle secrets. Initially so
    straightforward that anyone can pick it up and begin to play, yet
    gradually becoming difficult enough to tax even the brightest of
    minds. Have you got what it takes to solve Chroma?

    A terminal-based version of this game is available in the
    'chroma-curses' package.
