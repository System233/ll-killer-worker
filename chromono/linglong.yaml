    A circular color puzzle game
    chro.mono is a puzzle game originally developed in 2013 for mobile devices.
    The goal of the game is to touch half-colored spheres with full-colored
    spheres in such a way that all spheres are filledwith a single color each.
    Later on in the game, additional limitations and variations on the game
    mechanics plus time limits keep the gameplay interesting.
