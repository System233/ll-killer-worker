    graphical front-end for ClamAV
    ClamTk is a graphical front-end for Clam Antivirus.

    It is designed to be an easy-to-use, lightweight, on-demand antivirus scanner
    for Linux systems.

    Context menu support for KDE's Plasma Desktop (Dolphin file manager) and
    Nemo and Thunar sendto is included.  Context menu support for GNOME (Nautilus
    file manager), but due to additional dependencies required, it is in a
    separate package: clamtk-gnome.
