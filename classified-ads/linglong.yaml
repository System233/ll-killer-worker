    Program for displaying classified advertisement items
    Classified ads is an attempt to re-produce parts of the functionality
    that went away when usenet news ceased to exist. This attempt tries to
    fix the problem of disappearing news-servers so that there is no
    servers required; data storage is implemented inside client
    applications that users are running. Features of the program
    currently include
    * Posting of ads online, with categorization.
    * Replying to ads either in public or privately to operator.
    * Binary attachments to posts.
    * Providing basic data of operators
    * Basic searching of content based on words.
    * Audio negotiations between operators.
    * Possibility to extend the UI using Tcl scripting language
    * Sharing data between Tcl programs using general-purpose distributed db
