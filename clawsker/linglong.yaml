    Configuration tweaker for Claws Mail
    Clawsker is an applet to edit the so called Claws Mail hidden preferences.

    Claws Mail is a fast, lightweight and feature-rich MUA with a high number
    of configurable options. To keep the binary small and fast some of these
    preferences which not widely used are not provided with a graphical
    interface for inspection and/or modification.

    Users wanting to edit such preferences had to face raw edition of their
    configuration files, now you can do it with a convenient GTK+3 interface
    using Clawsker. In addition to hidden preferences, windows positions
    and/or sizes and keyboard shortcuts can be edited.
