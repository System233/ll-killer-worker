    lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager (deprecated)
    Clipboard manager with features such as:
    * Save history of your last copied items
    * Search through the history
    * Global hotkeys for most used functions
    * Execute actions with clipboard items
    * Exclude specific items from history

    ClipIt was forked from Parcellite and adds many bugfixes and features to the
    project.

    Diodon is a replacement for ClipIt, which is no longer supported.

    This package may be safely removed after the migration to Diodon is complete.
