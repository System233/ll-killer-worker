    "C" Language Integrated Production System
    CLIPS is an OPS-like forward chaining production system written
    in ANSI C by NASA. The CLIPS inference engine includes truth maintenance,
    dynamic rule addition, and customizable conflict resolution strategies.

    CLIPS, including the runtime version, is easily embeddable in other
    applications.  CLIPS includes an object-oriented language called COOL
    (CLIPS Object-Oriented Language) which is directly integrated with the
    inference engine.
