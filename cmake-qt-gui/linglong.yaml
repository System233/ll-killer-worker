    Qt based user interface for CMake (cmake-gui)
    CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
    simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake
    generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the
    compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it
    is possible to support complex environments requiring system
    configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
    instantiation.

    This package provides the CMake Qt based GUI. Project configuration
    settings may be specified interactively. Brief instructions are provided at
    the bottom of the window when the program is running. The main executable
    file for this GUI is "cmake-gui".
