    advanced clone of the MasterMind code-breaking game
    ColorCode is an advanced MasterMind code-breaking game clone. The
    program accepts setting the number of slots (from 2 to 5), the number
    of colors (from 2 to 10) and setting if colors might be repeated in
    the secret code (doubles allowed or not).  The game has 5 built-in
    levels, from level 1 (beginner: 2 slots and 2 colors, with doubles
    allowed) to level 5 (hard: 5 slots and 10 colors, with doubles
    allowed). ColorCode can make guesses in place of the user.
