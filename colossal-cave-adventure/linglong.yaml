    Colossal Cave Adventure game
    Explore Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and
    gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again.

    Colossal Cave Adventure (originally named “ADVENT” or “Adventure”) is
    the seminal text adventure game, written by Will Crowther and Don
    Woods.

    This is a re-implementation of the “350-point” version, using the
    same game content from the PDP-10 source code of the late 1970s.

    It uses the original text exactly, and emits responses slow enough to
    read as the contemporary terminal interfaces did.
