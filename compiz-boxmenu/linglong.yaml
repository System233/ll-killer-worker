    Compiz Reloaded - daemon and clients providing pop-up menus
    Boxmenu provides a number of different menus to the compositing window
    manager Compiz and possibly to other window managers as well.

    It is composed of a daemon that caches the different menus from various
    sources, following desktop standards and a number of clients to ask
    the daemon for a specific type of menu, clients that can be bound to
    different key-chords and mouse events using the Compizconfig Settings
    Manager.

    The components are compiz-boxmenu, compiz-boxmenu-editor, a menu editor
    and compiz-boxmenu-{daemon,dlist,dplist,vplist,wlist}, where the
    specialized clients are respectively for recent documents, desktops,
    viewports and windows.
