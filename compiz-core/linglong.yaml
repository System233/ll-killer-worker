    OpenGL window and compositing manager
    Compiz brings to life a variety of visual effects that make the Linux desktop
    easier to use, more powerful and intuitive, and more accessible for users
    with special needs.

    Compiz combines together a window manager and a composite manager using
    OpenGL for rendering. A "window manager" allows the manipulation of the
    multiple applications and dialog windows that are presented on the screen. A
    "composite manager" allows windows and other graphics to be combined together
    to create composite images. Compiz achieves its stunning effects by doing
    both of these functions.
