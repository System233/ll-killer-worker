    GUI based tool to compare two RTTY streams
    Comptty is used to compare two RTTY streams. It's comparison function uses a
    linear-programming technique.  It computes total number of errors, the
    character error rate (CER) and the bit error rate (BER).  Special attention is
    given to SHIFT and UNSHIFT to account for an error occurring in that character.
