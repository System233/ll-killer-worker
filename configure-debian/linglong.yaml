    central configuration program for packages using debconf
    configure-debian is a program which presents a list of packages which
    use Debconf, Debian's configuration management system.

    Debconf provides first-time installation wizards that run when a
    package is installed. You may reconfigure these packages at a later
    time, if you wish, and configure-debian makes that very easy.

    configure-debian splits the package lists into the subsections which
    make up the Debian archive, such as x11, base, gnome, or kde.
command:
- /opt/apps/configure-debian.linyaps/files/entrypoint.sh
