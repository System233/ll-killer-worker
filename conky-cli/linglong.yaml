    highly configurable system monitor (basic version)
    Conky is a system monitor that can display just about anything,
    either on your root desktop or in its own window.
    Conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute
    external programs or scripts (either external or through built-in
    Lua support).

    This is a basic package that can be useful in servers or piped with dzen2.
    It includes the following support:

    MPD, MOC, math, apcupsd, ncurses and I/O stats.
