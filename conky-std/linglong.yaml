    highly configurable system monitor (default version)
    Conky is a system monitor that can display just about anything,
    either on your root desktop or in its own window.
    Conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute
    external programs or scripts (either external or through built-in
    Lua support).

    This package should be a good compromise for most users that do not
    need special features.
    It includes the following support:

    Wayland, X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon,
    wireless, ncurses, apcupsd, I/O stats, argb and Lua.
