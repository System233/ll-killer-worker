    fully-featured GUI for ConnMan with systray support
    connman-gtk is a fully-featured GTK3 GUI for ConnMan with system tray
    support.

    connman-gtk targets all WMs/DMs. It works on any Linux WM/DM which
    provides a freedesktop-compliant system tray. (GNOME, KDE, Xfce,
    i3, awesome...)

    It supports the following features provided by the ConnMan API:

    * enable/disable a technology (Wired, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, P2P)
    * connect to/disconnect from a service
    * configure a service (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, NTP, proxies)
    * share current connection (tethering)

    connman-gtk is intended as the de-facto replacement for connman-ui.
