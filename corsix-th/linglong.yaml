    Open source clone of Theme Hospital
    Theme Hospital was a simulation computer game developed by Bullfrog
    Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1997, in which the player
    designs and operates a hospital.

    The game currently requires the original graphics and tries to mimic the
    original as closely as possible. Therefore you will need a copy of the
    original game for this package to be useful.
