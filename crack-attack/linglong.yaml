    multiplayer OpenGL puzzle game like "Tetris Attack"
    Crack Attack is an OpenGL puzzle game similar to the Super Nintendo
    game "Tetris Attack".  Slowly, your stack of colored blocks grows
    from the bottom, and you've got to make sure it never reaches the
    top. If it does, you lose. To eliminate blocks from the stack, line
    up at least three of one color, horizontally or vertically. Once you
    do, those blocks disappear, and put off slightly your inevitable
    demise.

    Crack Attack is very slow without hardware acceleration.  For Xorg
    users, this means you want DRI.
