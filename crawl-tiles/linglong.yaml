    Dungeon Crawl, a roguelike game, tiles version
    Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of games like Rogue, Hack, and
    Moria. Your objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex and
    retrieve the Orb of Zot, which is guarded by many horrible and hideous
    creatures.

    This is the graphical (tiles) version.

    This is the Stone Soup version of Dungeon Crawl.
