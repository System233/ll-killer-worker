    Dungeon Crawl, a text-based roguelike game
    Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of games like Rogue, Hack, and
    Moria. Your objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex and
    retrieve the Orb of Zot, which is guarded by many horrible and hideous
    creatures.

    This is the console version. For tiles, use crawl-tiles instead.

    This is the Stone Soup version of Dungeon Crawl.
