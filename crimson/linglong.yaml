    hex-based tactical game
    Crimson Fields is a hex-based tactical war game in the tradition of
    Battle Isle (tm). Two players command their units on a map of hexagons,
    trying to accomplish mission objectives ranging from defending important
    locations to simply destroying all enemy forces.
    The game can either be played in 'hot seat' mode, via email, or against
    the computer. Tools are available to create custom maps and campaigns.
    You can also play the original Battle Isle maps if you have a copy of
    the game.
