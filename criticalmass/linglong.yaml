    Shoot-em-up a la galaxian
    criticalmass, aka critter, is a shoot-'em-up in the style of Galaxian with
    very colorful and smooth graphics (provided that you have 3d acceleration)

    Note: criticalmass uses OpenGL, and will probably not run well if you do
    not have a 3d accelerator which is supported by X.
