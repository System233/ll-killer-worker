    Client for the multiplayer roguelike Crossfire
    Crossfire is a free, open-source, cooperative multi-player RPG and
    adventure game. Since its initial release, Crossfire has grown to
    encompass over 150 monsters, 3000 areas to explore, an elaborate
    magic system, 13 races, 15 character classes, and many powerful
    artifacts scattered far and wide. Set in a fantastical medieval
    world, it blends the style of Gauntlet, NetHack, Moria, and Angband.

    To play the game you'll need to have access to a local or remote
    server.
