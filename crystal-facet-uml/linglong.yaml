    Diagram documentation tool for system and software architecture:
    crystal-facet-uml creates sysml/uml diagrams to document system and
    software architecture.

    As software architect, you create a set of diagrams describing
    use-cases, requirements, structural views, behavioral and deployment
    views. crystal-facet-uml keeps element names and element hierarchies
    consistent. It exports diagrams in svg, pdf, ps and png formats to be
    used in text processing systems like DocBook, html, LaTeX.
    crystal-facet-uml exports the model to json and xmi format; json can
    also be imported. The json-based data format can be stored to git,
    branched and merged together with your source code.
    This tool runs on your local PC and is based on
    gtk (incl. glib, gdk, cairo, pango) and sqlite.
