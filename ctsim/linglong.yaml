    Computed tomography simulator
    CTSim provides an interactive computed tomography simulator. Computed
    tomography is the technique of estimating the interior of an object
    by measuring x-ray absorption through that object.

    CTSim has both command-line tools and a graphical user interface.
    CTSim has very educational trace modes for viewing the data
    collection simulation as well as the reconstruction.
