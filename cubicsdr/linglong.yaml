    Software Defined Radio receiver
    CubicSDR is a cross-platform Software-Defined Radio application which allows
    you to navigate the radio spectrum and demodulate any signals you might
    discover. It currently includes several common analog demodulation schemes such
    as AM and FM and will support digital modes in the future.

    CubicSDR uses SoapySDR to access SDR hardware and thereby supports all hardware
    for which a SoapySDR module exists.
