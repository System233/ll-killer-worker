    game about the interactions within a gardening community
    Cultivation is a game about a community of gardeners growing food for
    themselves in a shared space.

    Cultivation is quite different from most other games. It is a social
    simulation, and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant
    resources. There is no shooting, but there are plenty of angry looks. It is
    also an evolution simulation. Within the world of Cultivation, you can
    explore a virtually infinite spectrum of different plant and gardener
    varieties.
