    handy curtain for the desktop
    Curtain is a tool that shows a movable and resizable curtain
    on the desktop. This is especially useful when making
    presentations to hide and unhide things.

    Curtain is XInput-Aware, so you can use it
    with a graphic tablet or a whiteboard.

    This program has been implemented for educational purposes.
