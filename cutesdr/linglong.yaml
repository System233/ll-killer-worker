    simple demodulation and spectrum display program
    The CuteSDR application's primary purpose is for spawning custom
    applications or for educational use. It is NOT a full featured
    program as it is purposely kept simple in order for developers to
    more easily spin off their own applications. A further goal was to
    use only the stock functionality of Qt ie no libraries or special
    drivers. This limits CuteSDR to using only a network connection.
    The main gui and framework is written by Moe Wheatly, AE4JY.

    CuteSDR itself has only a network interface and will directly support
    the RFSPACE NetSDR and SDR-IP radios. The siqs_ftdi and SDRxxServer
    applications (packaged separately) provide network interfaces to
    RFSPACE USB devices.
