    Music player for GNUstep
    Cynthiune is a free software, romantic and extensible music player for
    GNUstep and Mac OS X. Similar in look and feel to XMMS, it can read the
    most-known sound file formats: MP3, Ogg, FLAC, Mod, XM, AIFF, WAV and many
    more...

    Very easy to use, it integrates well with the GNUstep desktop environment and
    shows a nice example of a cross-platform OpenStep application.
