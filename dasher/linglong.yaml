  description: |-
    graphical predictive text input system
    Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural
    continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system
    wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example,

    * on a palmtop computer
    * on a wearable computer
    * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball,
    or mouse
    * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by
    eyetracker).

    The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write text
    as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse,
    experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.

    Dasher uses a more advanced prediction algorithm than the T9(tm) system
    often used in mobile phones, making it sensitive to surrounding context.
