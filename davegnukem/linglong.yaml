    Retro-style 2D scrolling platform shooter
    Dave Gnukem is an open source retro-style 2D scrolling platform shooter,
    inspired by and similar to Duke Nukem 1. It currently runs on Windows, macOS,
    Linux and various other platforms. It is written in C++ using SDL library and
    it features an integrated level editor as well. This game is not really a
    clone or remake, it is probably most akin to a parody.
