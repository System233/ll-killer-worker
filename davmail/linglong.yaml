    POP/IMAP/SMTP/CalDav/LDAP to Microsoft Exchange gateway - GUI
    Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is
    a POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP exchange gateway allowing users to use any
    mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning or Apple iCal) with an
    Exchange server, even from the internet or behind a firewall through Outlook
    Web Access. DavMail now includes an LDAP gateway to Exchange global address
    book and user personal contacts to allow recipient address completion in mail
    compose window and full calendar support with attendees free/busy display.

    The main goal of DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front
    of proprietary Exchange. This means LDAP for global address book, SMTP to send
    messages, IMAP to browse messages on the server in any folder, POP to retrieve
    inbox messages only, Caldav for calendar support and Carddav for personal
    contacts sync. Thus any standard compliant client can be used with Microsoft
    Exchange.

    This binary package contains the full GUI.
