    simulate the evolution of recombinant DNA sequences
    DNA Assembly with Gaps (Dawg) is an application designed to simulate the
    evolution of recombinant DNA sequences in continuous time based on the robust
    general time reversible model with gamma and invariant rate heterogeneity and
    a novel length-dependent model of gap formation. The application accepts
    phylogenies in Newick format and can return the sequence of any node,
    allowing for the exact evolutionary history to be recorded at the discretion
    of users. Dawg records the gap history of every lineage to produce the true
    alignment in the output. Many options are available to allow users to
    customize their simulations and results.
