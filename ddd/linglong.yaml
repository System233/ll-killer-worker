    Data Display Debugger, a graphical debugger frontend
    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a popular graphical user interface to
    UNIX debuggers such as GDB, DBX, XDB, JDB and others. Besides typical
    front-end features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD
    provides an interactive graphical data display, where data structures are
    displayed as graphs. Using DDD, you can reason about your application by
    watching its data, not just by viewing it execute lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in Ada, Bash, C,
    C++, Chill, Fortran, Java, Modula, Pascal, Perl and Python; machine-level
    debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint, backtrace,
    and history editors; preferences and settings editors; program execution
    in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote host; on-line manual;
    interactive help on the Motif user interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line
    interface with full editing, history, and completion capabilities.

    This version is linked against Lesstif, an LGPL-ed implementation of Motif.
