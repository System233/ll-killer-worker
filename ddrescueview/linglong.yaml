    graphical viewer for GNU ddrescue map files
    This small tool allows the user to graphically examine ddrescue's map files
    in a user friendly GUI application. The Main window displays a block grid
    with each block's color representing the block types it contains. Many people
    know this type of view from defragmentation programs.

    Features:
    * Display ddrescue map in a colored block graphic
    * Examine each block in the image, see a detailed list of
    map entries contained
    * To keep track of the rescue process, ddrescueview can automatically
    re-read the mapfile
    * Units can be displayed with decimal (KB, MB...) or
    binary (KiB, MiB...) prefixes
