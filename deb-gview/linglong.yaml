  description: |-
    GNOME viewer for .deb package files and contents
    Displays Debian control information, devscript details and
    details of the files that would be installed (names,
    sizes and locations). Files within the package can be
    viewed within the package or externally.

    Accepts package locations on the command line to support
    the 'open' command in various file managers, one window
    for each package. Packages do not need to be installed
    to be viewed. Opening a changes file opens a new window
    for each package specified in the changes file.

    Individual package files or packages referenced in a
    changes file can be viewed from local or remote
    filesystems.
