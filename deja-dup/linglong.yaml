    Backup utility
    Déjà Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of backing up the
    Right Way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses duplicity as the
    backend.

    Features:
    * Support for local, remote, or cloud backup locations such as Nextcloud
    * Securely encrypts and compresses your data
    * Incrementally backs up, letting you restore from any particular backup
    * Schedules regular backups
    * Integrates well into your GNOME desktop

    Déjà Dup is a GNOME Circle app.
