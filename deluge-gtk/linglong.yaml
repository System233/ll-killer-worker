    bittorrent client written in Python/PyGTK (GTK+ ui)
    Deluge is a full-featured, multi-platform, multi-interface BitTorrent client
    using libtorrent-rasterbar in it's backend and featuring multiple
    user-interfaces: GTK+, web and console.

    It has been designed using the client-server model with a daemon process that
    handles all the bittorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on
    headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely
    from any platform.

    You may want to install this package to use the Deluge GTK+ user-interface
    as a thin client and connect to a remote daemon.
