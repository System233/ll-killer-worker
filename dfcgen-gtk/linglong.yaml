    Digital Filter Coefficients Generator (DFCGen) GTK+
    DFCGen, the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator, assists the engineer
    in the design of digital filters. It supports the engineer in analysis
    and synthesis of linear time-invariant time-discrete (LTI) systems from
    the theoretical point of view. It performs generation of system transfer
    function coefficients in the Z-domain, based on the type and specific
    parameters of a chosen system.
