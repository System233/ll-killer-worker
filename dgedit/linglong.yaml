    drum kit editor for DrumGizmo
    DGEdit allows one to create drum kits for use in DrumGizmo from recordings of
    individual instruments (snare, kickdrum, toms, crashes, and so on). It
    supports the entire process of taking a group of WAV files and converting them
    into working instruments with hit energy levels.
