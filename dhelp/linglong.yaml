    online help system
    Read all documentation with a WWW browser. dhelp builds an index of
    all installed HTML documentation. You don't need a WWW server to read
    the documentation. dhelp offers a very fast search in the HTML documents.

    You can access the online help system with the dhelp program or with
    your browser. The URL to point your browser at is (if you have a WWW
    server installed) http://localhost/doc/HTML/index.html , else (if you
    do not) file://localhost/usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html.
