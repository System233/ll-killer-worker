    graphical tool for merging and comparing text files
    Diffuse is a graphical tool for merging and comparing text files. Diffuse is
    able to compare an arbitrary number of files side-by-side and gives users the
    ability to manually adjust line-matching and directly edit files. Diffuse can
    also retrieve revisions of files from bazaar, CVS, darcs, git, mercurial,
    monotone, Subversion and GNU Revision Control System (RCS) repositories for
    comparison and merging.
