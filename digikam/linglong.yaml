    digital photo management application for KDE
    Digital photo management program designed to import, organize, enhance, search
    and export your digital images to and from your computer.

    It provides a simple interface which makes importing and organizing digital
    photographs a "snap". digiKam enables you to manage large numbers of
    digital photographs in albums and to organize these photographs for easy
    retrieval using tags (keywords), captions, collections, dates, geolocation
    and searches. It has many features for viewing, organizing, processing and
    sharing your images. Thus, digiKam is a formidable digital asset management
    (DAM) software including powerful image editing functions.

    An easy-to-use camera interface is provided, that will connect to your
    digital camera and download photographs directly into digiKam albums.
    More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library.
    Of course, any media or card reader supported by your operating system
    will interface with digiKam.

    digiKam incorporates a fast Image Editor with many image editing tools.
    You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs, comment and rate
    them, correct, enhance and alter them. The editing power can be easily
    extended by a set of plugins, the KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual)

    While digiKam remains easy to use, it provides professional level features
    by the dozens. It is fully 16 bit enabled including all available plugins,
    supports RAW format conversion through libraw, DNG export and ICC color
    management work flow.
