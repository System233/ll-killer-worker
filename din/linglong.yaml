    digital audio synthesizer
    din is a musical instrument and audio synthesizer. It allows one to use
    Bezier curves to draw and sculpt waveforms, create gating and modulation
    patterns and create delay feedback and volume patterns. It's possible to
    create and edit an unlimited number of drones, sculpt their waveform and
    visually modulate them.

    din uses JACK to output audio, it supports MIDI, OSC and an IRC bot for
    input. din can be extended and customised with Tcl scripts too.
