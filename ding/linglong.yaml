    Graphical dictionary lookup program for Unix (Tk)
    This is "Ding"
    * a dictionary lookup program for Unix,
    * DIctionary Nice Grep,
    * a Tk based Front-End to [ae]grep, (hun|a|i)spell, dict, ...
    * Ding {n} :: thing

    This package needs tre-agrep(1), agrep(1) or egrep(1) as a back end.
    (tre-)agrep is preferable, because it supports fault tolerant
    searching.

    You have to install some translation dictionary word list with a
    word/phrase in two languages in one line with some kind of separator
    between them.  The default configuration of ding uses the
    German-English dictionary which can be found in the trans-de-en
    package, but you can use every other translation word lists with one
    entry per line.
