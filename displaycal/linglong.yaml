    Graphical user interface for the Argyll CMS.
    Calibrates and characterizes display devices using a hardware sensor,
    driven by the open source color management system Argyll CMS.
    Supports multi-display setups and a variety of available settings like
    customizable whitepoint, luminance, black level, tone response curve
    as well as the creation of matrix and look-up-table ICC profiles with
    optional gamut mapping. Calibrations and profiles can be verified
    through measurements, and profiles can be installed to make them
    available to color management aware applications.
    Profile installation can utilize Argyll CMS, Oyranos and/or GNOME
    Color Manager if available, for flexible integration.
