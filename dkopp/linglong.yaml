    Full and incremental backup to DVD
    Dkopp is a program used to copy or back-up disk files to DVD or
    BD (Blue-ray) media. Full or incremental backups can be done,
    with full or incremental media verification. A GUI is used to
    navigate through directories to select or de-select files or
    directories at any level. Backup jobs can be saved for later re-use.
    New, deleted, and updated disk files are handled automatically,
    without re-editing the backup job. An incremental backup updates
    the same DVD/BD media used for a prior full backup. Files can be
    restored to the same or another location on disk. Large backup
    jobs can be done using multiple DVD media.
