    enhanced version of the legendary DOOM game - server
    The purpose of the Doomsday Engine project is to create versions of DOOM,
    Heretic and Hexen that feel the same as the original games but are implemented
    using modern techniques such as 3D graphics and client/server networking. A
    lot of emphasis is placed on good-looking graphics.

    This package contains the dedicated server.
