  description: |-
    drug-dealing game set in streets of New York City
    UNIX rewrite of the MS-DOS program of the same name, which in turn was
    inspired by John E. Dell's "Drug Wars" game. You have one month to buy and
    sell drugs on the streets of New York, the aim being first to pay off your
    debt to the loan shark and then to make a fortune. And if you have to shoot
    a few cops in the process, well... The game includes TCP networking allowing
    you to meet (and shoot) other human drug dealers.
