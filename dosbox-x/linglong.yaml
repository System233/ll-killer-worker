    DOS emulator with complete, accurate hardware emulation
    DOSBox-X is a comprehensive DOS emulator, supporting DOS applications
    including Windows 3.x and Windows 9x, and striving to provide accurate
    hardware emulation. It is based on the original DOSBox and includes
    features from a number of forks including SVN Daum, ECE, DOSBox
    Staging, DOSVAX, and vDosPlus.

    Its features include:
    - a built-in drop-down menu
    - a graphical configuration tool
    - support for save-states
    - NEC PC-98, AX, and J-3100 emulations
    - DOS/V support for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language support
    - support for CONFIG.SYS commands
    - printing support
    - long filename support
    - DOS SHARE emulation
    - wheel mouse support (including the CuteMouse wheel mouse API)
    - 3Dfx Voodoo chip emulation
    - NE2000 emulation
    - MT-32 emulation

    DOSBox-X isn't a direct upgrade from DOSBox, but DOSBox users should
    be able to use DOSBox-X without difficulty.
