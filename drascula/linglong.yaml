    Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back is a classic humorous 2D point and click
    adventure game, first released by Alcachofa Soft S.L. in 1996.

    In Drascula you play the role of John Hacker, a British estate agent, that
    gets to meet a gorgeous blond girl who is kidnapped by the notorious vampire
    Count Drascula and embark on a fun yet dangerous quest to rescue her.

    Unfortunately Hacker is not aware of Drascula's real ambitions:

    DOMINATING the World and demonstrating that he is even more evil than his
    brother Vlad.

    This is the English version of Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back. It also
    features voice output and subtitles.

    Please install the drascula-music package to enjoy the background music of the
    game. There are furthermore additional language packages available with
    subtitles in Spanish, German, French and Italian.

    Note that this package only contains game-data. The game engine is provided by
