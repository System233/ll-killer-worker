  description: |-
    crystal structure viewer
    DRAWxtl reads a basic description of the crystal structure, which includes
    unit-cell parameters, space group, atomic coordinates, thermal parameters or
    a Fourier map, and outputs a geometry object that contains polyhedra, planes,
    lone-pair cones, spheres or ellipsoids, bonds, iso-surface Fourier contours
    and the unit-cell boundary.

    Four forms of graphics are produced:

    * an OpenGL window for immediate viewing
    * the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-RAY) scene language for
    publication-quality drawings
    * the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for dissemination
    across the Internet
    * a Postscript rendering of the OpenGL window for those who want
    high-quality output but do not have POV-RAY installed.

    File formats DRAWxtl can read include CIF, FDAT, FullProf (pcr), GSAS, SCHAKAL,
    SHELX, DISCUS and WIEN2k.
