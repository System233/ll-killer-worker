    3D chess game
    DreamChess features 3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board sets,
    ranging from classic wooden to flat.

    A moderately strong chess engine is included: Dreamer. However, should this
    engine be too weak for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible chess
    engine, including the popular Crafty and GNU Chess.

    Other features include on-screen move lists using SAN notation, undo
    functionality, and savegames in PGN format.
