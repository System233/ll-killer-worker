    picks out and displays images from network traffic
    Inspired by EtherPEG, Driftnet is a program which listens to network
    traffic and picks out images from TCP streams it observes. It is
    interesting to run it on a host which sees a lot of web traffic.

    (Obviously, this is an invasion of privacy of a fairly blatant sort.
    Also, if you are possessed of Victorian sensibilities, and share an
    unswitched network with others who are not, you should probably not
    use it.)
