    Crash handler for Qt applications
    Drkonqi shows a dialog for dealing with application crashes.

    Drkonqi also doesn't technically require a process to actually crash, you
    can simply run it manually on any old pid. Do note that in most cases you
    only need to define the pid, however not giving certain cmdline options can
    change behavior somewhat drastically (e.g. kdeinit vs. notkdeinit behaves
    radically different as far as process name detection goes) . Drkonqi has a
    number of backends that may be used. Backends are stacked by order of
    preference, backends in the directory of the binary are most preferred.
    This means that you can dump debuggers/internal/ into your build's bin/
    directory and override for example gdb. This essentially allows you to
    replace the gdb debugger with a cat of a fixture file to not have to trace
    live processes at all.
