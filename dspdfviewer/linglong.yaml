    Dual-Screen PDF Viewer for LaTeX-beamer
    This is a specialized PDF Viewing application custom-made for
    the LaTeX class beamer, specifically the
    "show notes on second screen=right" option.

    To make use of this program, you will need a document created
    by latex-beamer, and you will need two monitors connected to
    your computer.
    They do not need to have the same resolution, not even the same
    aspect ratio.

    This program will split your PDF page in half, and display the
    left half (intended for the audience) on one monitor (think:
    a notebook's VGA output connected to your university's projector)
    and it will display the right half (intended for you) on the
    second screen.
    Also, on the second screen, you get page thumbnails and status
    information, like the time since you started the presentation
    and a "wall clock".
