    GUI tool to find duplicate files in a system
    dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer.

    It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a
    fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when
    they are not exactly the same.

    dupeGuru is customizable: you can tweak its matching engine to find
    exactly the kind of duplicates you want to find.
