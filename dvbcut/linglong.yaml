    Qt application for cutting parts out of DVB streams
    DVBcut is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of an
    MPEG transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting, DVB) and
    save these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a `keyhole
    surgery'' approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept
    unchanged, and only very few frames at the beginning and/or end of the
    selected range are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.
