    Read all on-line documentation with a WWW browser
    All installed on-line documentation will be served via a local HTTP
    server at http://localhost/dwww/. This package runs cron scripts to
    convert available resources to the HTML pages.  Executing the dwww
    command starts a sensible WWW browser locally to access them.

    You need to install a CGI-capable HTTP server and enable its CGI script
    capability manually (CGI may be disabled by default for the security
    consideration).  For apache2, do something along the following:

    $ sudo a2enmod cgid
    $ sudo systemctl restart apache2

    The default for the HTTP/CGI access is limited to the local user for
    the security consideration.
