    Edit audio file tags
    Ear Tag is a simple audio file tag editor. It is primarily geared towards
    making quick edits or bulk-editing tracks in albums/EPs.
    Unlike other tagging programs, Ear Tag does not require the user to set up
    a music library folder.

    Ear Tag supports both desktop and mobile form factors.

    Ear Tag is a GNOME Circle app.
