    Audio effects for PipeWire applications
    This program provides various audio effects for PipeWire
    applications.

    This application was formerly known as PulseEffects,
    but it was renamed to EasyEffects after it started to use
    GTK4 and GStreamer usage was replaced by native PipeWire filters.
