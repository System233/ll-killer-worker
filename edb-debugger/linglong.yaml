    cross platform x86/x86-64 debugger
    edb is a graphical cross platform x86/x86-64 debugger.
    It was inspired by Ollydbg, but aims to function on x86
    and x86-64 as well as multiple OS's. Linux is the only
    officially supported platform at the moment, but FreeBSD,
    OpenBSD, OSX and Windows ports are underway with varying
    degrees of functionality.
