    Graphical User Interface for EekBoek
    This package includes ebwxshell, the EekBoek GUI.  It offers
    an EekBoek browser, useful for viewing the administrative data.  It's
    especially useful for generating, printing and pinpointing reports.
    Furthermore, it offers a raw interface to the EekBoek Shell.  Finally,
    it offers a Wizard to help configuring new bookkeeping administrations.

    Install it if you need a friendly interface to the EekBoek reporting
    facilities, or if you would like help in configuring EekBoek.  However,
    if you prefer working in pure text mode, or don't like to install the WX
    graphical packages, you should not install this package.
