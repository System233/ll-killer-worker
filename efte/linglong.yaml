    Advanced lightweight configurable editor
    eFTE is an advanced programmers editor with goals of being lightweight, yet
    totally configurable.  Support for user defined programming languages, menu
    systems and key bindings are provided with many common defaults already
    defined.

    eFTE is still a new project, however, extended from the FTE editor which was
    first released in 1995, so eFTE is tried and true with many features for the
    programmer/text editor.
