    EiskaltDC++ GUI based on GTK+
    This package contains EiskaltDC++ program with GUI based on GTK+. Initially it
    was based on FreeDC++ and LinuxDC++ projects, but now it significantly differs
    from them.

    Upstream developers are going to stop support of this GUI in the future.
    Consider using of EiskaltDC++ Qt even in GTK+ based Desktop Environments.

    EiskaltDC++ is a cross-platform program that uses the Direct Connect and
    Advanced Direct Connect protocols. It is compatible with DC++, AirDC++,
    FlylinkDC++ and other DC clients. EiskaltDC++ also interoperates with all
    common DC hub software.
