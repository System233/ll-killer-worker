    Simple music player with a focus on Plasma desktop integration and privacy
    Elisa is a music player developed by the KDE community that strives to be
    simple and nice to use. It tries to be flexible to account for different
    workflows and use-cases. It focuses on a very good integration with the
    Plasma desktop of the KDE community without compromising the support for
    other environments.

    Elisa is developed using modern KDE technologies and aims to be reliable
    and respectful of usersâ€™ privacy. As such, it favors online services where
    users are in control of their data.
