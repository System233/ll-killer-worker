    GNU Emacs editor (with GTK+ GUI support)
    GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.  This
    package contains a version of Emacs with a graphical user interface
    based on GTK+ for X11 and Wayland (instead of the Lucid toolkit
    provided by the emacs-lucid package).

    If you are using Wayland, you may wish to install emacs-pgtk instead.
