    GNU Emacs editor (with Lucid GUI support)
    GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.  This
    package contains a version of Emacs with support for a graphical user
    interface based on the Lucid toolkit (instead of the GTK+ interface
    provided by the emacs-gtk package).  Until some known GTK+
    problems are fixed, this version may help avoid crashing Emacs during
    an emacsclient disconnect.  See
    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567934 and
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85715 for more
    information.
