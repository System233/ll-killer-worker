    GNU Emacs editor (with GTK+ Wayland GUI support)
    GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.  This
    package contains a version of Emacs with a graphical user interface
    based on GTK+ for Wayland.

    If you are using exclusively X11, install emacs-gtk instead.  The
    PGTK port works less well than the standard GTK+ build in a number of
    respects.
