    Send event reminders by email
    Email-reminder allows users to define events that they want to be reminded of
    by email.  Possible events include birthdays, anniversaries and yearly events.
    Reminders can be sent on the day of the event and/or a few days beforehand.

    This package includes the cron job that checks for events and send reminders
    once a daily.

    Make sure you install the anacron package if your computer is turned off at
    night or the reminders will never get sent.
