    web-based GUI to EMBOSS
    EMBOSS explorer is a web-based graphical user interface
    to the EMBOSS suite of bioinformatics tools. It is written
    in Perl.

    If you use the Apache HTTP server, you will at most have to restart it before
    using EMBOSS explorer. For other web servers, you will have to do the
    configuration by yourself.
