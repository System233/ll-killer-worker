    war game of the century
    Empire is a console game simulation of a full-scale war between two
    emperors, the computer and you. Naturally, there is only room for
    one, so the object of the game is to destroy the other.

    The world on which the game takes place is a square rectangle containing
    cities, land and water. Cities are used to build armies, planes, and
    ships which can move across the world destroying enemy pieces, exploring,
    and capturing more cities.

    The classic game from the 1980s uses text mode graphical output, drawing
    your units, cities and the world in color. Commands are issued using
    the keyboard.
