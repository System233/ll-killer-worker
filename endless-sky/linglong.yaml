    Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines
    on your current one.

    Blow up pirates.

    Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose

    Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite,
    Escape Velocity, or Star Control.
    You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do
    from there.
    The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can
    choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as
    a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.
