    first person 3d-shooter game
    Enemy Lines 7 is a single-player game. You have to shoot down enemy
    bombers threatening your city in a three-dimensional environment.

    Enemy bombers are approaching Glysen, your capital. The situation is without
    hope. But with the new experimental mech you can at least try to take as many
    of them with you as possible.
