    Game where you control a marble with the mouse
    Enigma is a puzzle game similar to Oxyd on the Atari ST or Rock'n'Roll
    on the Amiga and good old Marble Madness. It also has Sokoban levels, and
    some interesting twists on the original sokoban concept.

    In Enigma, your objective is to locate and uncover matching pairs of
    Oxyd stones. Simple as it sounds, this task is made more difficult by
    the fact that Oxyd stones tend to be hidden, inaccessible or protected
    by unexpected traps. Overcoming these obstacles often requires a lot
    of dexterity and wit (and can be quite addictive).

    This package contains the game engine.
