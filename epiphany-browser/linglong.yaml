    Intuitive GNOME web browser
    Epiphany is a simple yet powerful GNOME web browser targeted at
    non-technical users. Its principles are simplicity and standards
    compliance.

    Simplicity is achieved by a well designed user interface and reliance
    on external applications for performing external tasks (such as reading
    email). Simplicity does not mean less features; Epiphany has everything
    a modern web browser is expected to have.

    Standards compliance is achieved on the HTML side by using the
    WebKitGTK+ rendering engine (which is based on the engine used by
    Apple Safari and Google Chrome); and on the user interface side by
    closely following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and by
    close integration with the GNOME desktop.
