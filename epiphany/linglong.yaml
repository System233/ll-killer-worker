    clone of Boulder Dash game
    Epiphany is a multi-platform clone of Boulder Dash.
    In this game, the player must collect all the valuable minerals
    scattered in each level, while avoiding being hit by a falling
    boulder or, worse, by a bomb.

    Boulder Dash was one of the best games ever made for the
    Commodore 64.
