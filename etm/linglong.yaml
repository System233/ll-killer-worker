    Manage events and tasks using simple text files
    etm is an acronym for event and task manager.

    In contrast to most calendar/todo applications, creating items (events,
    tasks, and so forth) in etm does not require filling out fields in a
    form. Instead, items are created as free-form text entries using a
    simple, intuitive format and stored in plain text files.
