  description: |-
    media-rich model, simulation construction kit and authoring tool
    Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
    starLOGO.  It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple
    powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
    end-users that runs on many platforms, and is free and open source.  It
    includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles, presentations,
    web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc.  It includes the ability to
    share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many forms of
    immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.

    This is the Squeak image developed for the OLPC project.
