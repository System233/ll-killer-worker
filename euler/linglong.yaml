    interactive mathematical programming environment
    Euler is a powerful numerical laboratory with a programming language.
    The system can handle real, complex and interval numbers, vectors and
    matrices. It can produce 2D/3D plots.

    Euler features among other things:
    * real, complex and interval scalars and matrices
    * a programming language, with local variables, default values for
    parameters, variable parameter number, passing of functions
    * two and three dimensional graphs
    * marker plots
    * density and contour plots
    * animations
    * numerical integration and differentiation
    * statistical functions and tests
    * differential equations
    * interval methods with guaranteed inclusions
    * function minimizers (Brent, Nelder-Mean)
    * simplex algorithm
    * interpolation and approximation
    * finding roots of polynomials
    * fast Fourier transform (FFT)
    * an exact scalar product using a long accumulator
    * PostScript graphics export

    This package contains the main program. Documentation for Euler is included
    in the euler-doc package.
