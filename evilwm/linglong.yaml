    minimalist window manager for X11
    evilwm is based on aewm by Decklin Foster. It's minimalist
    in that it omits unnecessary stuff like window decorations
    and icons. But it's very usable in that it provides good
    keyboard control with repositioning and maximize toggles,
    solid window drags, snap-to-border support, and virtual desktops.
