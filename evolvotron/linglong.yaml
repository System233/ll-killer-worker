    Generator of textures through interactive evolution
    This is an interactive generative art application to evolve
    images/textures/patterns/animations through an iterative process of random
    mutation and user-selection driven evolution. This process is also often
    referred to as "evolutionary art" or "genetic art". If you like lava lamps,
    and still think the Mandelbrot set is cool, this could be the software for
    you.
