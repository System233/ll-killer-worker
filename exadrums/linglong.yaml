    Software drum module (graphical user interface)
    ExaDrums is a virtual drum module that allows drummers play with
    custom-made drum kits.

    It is user-friendly and combines high quality stereo sound with low
    latency.

    Each drum kit provides individual sliders in order to control the
    volume of its drum pads.

    A built-in metronome can be combined with a rhythm coach to make
    practice sessions easier and efficient.

    The drum triggers can be adjusted so that their response feels as
    natural as possible, and different sensor interfaces include a
    virtual (on-screen) multi pad and external sensors.

    Although eXaDrums is usable as a drum module, it is still an
    experimental project. As such, some features are not yet implemented,
    and the error management is not complete.

    This package provides the graphical user interface.
