    abstract vertical shooter with two sides to play on
    Excellent Bifurcation is a vertical shooter in which you have two sides
    available to play on. Its graphics try to mimic the colours, sounds and
    feeling of the 8-bit games.

    In the game, you drive two ships at the same time, on two sides of the
    screen. The game play is very unique and fun. It might be quite a brain
    bender anyway.

    Excellent Bifurcation was Linley Henzel's entry in the AutoFire 2007 Shooter
    Competition, and finished in 2nd place.
