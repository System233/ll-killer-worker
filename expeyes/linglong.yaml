    hardware & software framework for developing science experiments
    This package provides high level interfaces for making science experiments
    with an ExpEYES box.

    ExpEYES is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
    Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
    developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
    science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
    measurements and analysing the data in different ways. Analog
    voltages are measured with 0.025% resolution and time intervals with
    one microsecond. This project is based on Free and Open Source
    software, mostly written in Python programming language. The hardware
    design is also open.
