    3D racing game featuring Tux, the Linux penguin
    Extreme Tux Racer, or etracer as it is called for short, is a simple OpenGL
    racing game featuring Tux, the Linux mascot. The goal of the game is to slide
    down a snow- and ice-covered mountain as quickly as possible, avoiding the
    trees and rocks that will slow you down.

    Collect herrings and other goodies while sliding down the hill, but avoid fish
    bones.

    This game is based on the GPL version of the famous game TuxRacer.

    You must have working 3D acceleration or this game will run quite slowly.
