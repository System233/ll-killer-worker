    hardware & software framework for developing science experiments
    This package provides high level interfaces for making science experiments
    with an ExpEYES-17 box.

    ExpEYES-17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
    Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
    developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
    science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
    measurements and analysing the data in different ways. When compared with
    previous ExpEYES boxes (Expeyes, Expeyes-Junior), ExpEYES-17 is richer
    in various features: multiple soft input ranges, more flexible wave
    generator, better time resolution, better voltage resolution, supports
    seamlessly cheap I2C sensors.
