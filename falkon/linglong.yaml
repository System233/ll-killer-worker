    lightweight web browser based on Qt WebEngine
    Falkon is a new and very fast Qt Webengine browser. It aims to be a
    lightweight web browser available through all major platforms.

    Falkon has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It
    includes bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above
    that, you can manage RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads
    with a builtin AdBlock plugin, block Flash content with Click2Flash
    and edit the local CA Certificates database with an SSL Manager.
