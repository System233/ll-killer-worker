    graphic Fcitx configuration tool
    Fcitx is the Free Chinese Input Toy of X, which was initially designed
    for Chinese users, and used XIM protocol. Now it has already evolved
    into a highly modularized, feature rich input method framework for
    Unix-like platforms supporting a considerable amount of frontends,
    backends and modules.

    It is an ideal choice for the vast majority. Many of its features make
    users of Unix-like platforms have a fully modern input experience for
    the first time. It has also greatly lower the threshold for developers,
    making the development of extended functions much easier than ever before.

    This package provides a graphical configuration tool.
