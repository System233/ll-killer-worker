    Flexible Input Method Framework - essential data files
    Fcitx is an input method framework with extension support, which provides
    an interface for entering characters of different scripts in applications
    using a variety of mapping systems.

    It offers a pleasant and modern experience, with intuitive graphical
    configuration tools and customizable skins and mapping tables. It is
    highly modularized and extensible, with GTK+ 2/3 and Qt 4/5 IM Modules, support
    for UIs based on Fbterm, pure Xlib, GTK+, or KDE, and a developer-friendly
    API.

    This package provides the essential data files. If you are looking for a
    working input experience, please install the package "fcitx" instead.
