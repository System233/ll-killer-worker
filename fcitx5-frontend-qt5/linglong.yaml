    Qt5 IM module for fcitx5
    Fcitx5 is the next generation of fcitx input method framework. It
    provides pleasant and modern input experience with intuitive graphical
    configuration tools. The framework is highly extensible with support
    for GTK+ and Qt toolkits, DBus interfaces, a large variety of desktop
    environments and a developer-friendly API.

    Some of its new features include support of both Wayland and Xorg
    and the ability to mimic IBus Input Method Framework in order to
    provide better compatibility across different Linux distributions
    and desktop environments.

    This package provides the Qt5 IM Module for fcitx5.
