    imlib2 based image viewer
    feh is a fast, lightweight image viewer which uses imlib2. It is
    commandline-driven and supports multiple images through
    slideshows, thumbnail browsing or multiple windows, and montages
    or index prints (using TrueType fonts to display file info).
    Advanced features include fast dynamic zooming, progressive
    loading, loading via HTTP (with reload support for watching
    webcams), recursive file opening (slideshow of a directory
    hierarchy), and mouse wheel/keyboard control.
