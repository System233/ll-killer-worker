    Interactive data visualization and analysis environment
    Ferret is an interactive computer visualization and analysis environment
    designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and meteorologists analyzing
    large and complex gridded data sets. It can transparently access extensive
    remote Internet data bases using OPeNDAP (formerly known as DODS)

    Ferret has a Mathematica-like flexibility, geophysical formatting,
    "intelligent" connection to its data base, memory management for very large
    calculations, and symmetrical processing in 4 dimensions. It can work on both
    gridded and non-gridded datasets.
