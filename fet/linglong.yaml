    timetable generator
    FET is a program for automatically generating the timetable of a school,
    high-school or university.

    Usually, FET is able to solve a complicated timetable in maximum 5-20 minutes.
    For simpler timetables, it may take a shorter time, under 5 minutes (in some
    cases, a matter of seconds). For extremely difficult timetables, it may take
    a longer time, a matter of hours.
