    FFADO D-Bus mixer applets
    FFADO is a Linux driver for FireWire (IEEE1394) audio devices.

    The FFADO library permits discovering and configuring such
    devices and provides an API for streaming clients.

    This package holds the mixer and control applications that
    communicate with ffado-dbus-server.

    Despite the package name, the GUI has been updated.
