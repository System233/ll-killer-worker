    static HTML+JavaScript photo album generator
    “fgallery” is a static photo gallery generator with no frills that has a
    stylish, minimalist look. “fgallery” shows your photos, and nothing else.

    There is no server-side processing, only static generation. The resulting
    gallery can be uploaded anywhere without additional requirements and works with
    any modern browser.

    * Automatically orients pictures without quality loss.
    * Multi-camera friendly: automatically sorts pictures by time: just throw your
    (and your friends) photos and movies in a directory. The resulting gallery
    shows the pictures in seamless shooting order.
    * Adapts to the current screen size and proportions, switching from
    horizontal/vertical layout and scaling thumbnails automatically.
    * Includes original (raw) pictures in a zip file for downloading.
    * Panoramas can be seen full-size by default.
