    show where your diskspace is being used
    Filelight allows you to understand your disk usage by graphically
    representing your filesystem as a set of concentric, segmented rings.

    It is like a pie-chart, but the segments nest, allowing you to see both
    which directories take up all your space, and which directories
    and files inside those directories are the real culprits.
