    educational network simulator
    This simulation tool supports studying and teaching the technology
    behind computer networks.

    Starting from two connected devices up to separate local area
    networks connected to the internet, many protocols, services and
    applications are available, waiting to be explored.

    Filius provides simulated desktops, servers, switches, routers and
    quite some specifics on Ethernet and the TCP/IP protocol suite.
