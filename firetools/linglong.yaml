    Qt frontend for the Firejail application sandbox
    Firejail is a SUID security sandbox program that reduces the risk of
    security breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted
    applications using Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf.  It allows a
    process and all its descendants to have their own private view of the
    globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack, process
    table, mount table.

    This package contains the Qt-based frontend Firetools.
