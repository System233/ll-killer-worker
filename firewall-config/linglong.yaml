    network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections
    or interfaces. It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for
    ethernet bridges and has a separation of runtime and persistent
    configuration options.
    It also provides a D-Bus interface for services or applications to add
    and apply firewall rules on-the-fly.
