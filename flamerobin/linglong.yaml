    graphical database administration tool for Firebird DBMS
    FlameRobin is a graphical database administration tool for Firebird database
    management system.

    Its goals are:
    - to be lightweight (small footprint, fast execution)
    - cross-platform (Linux, Windows for start, others planned too)
    - dependent only on other open source software

    You need to setup firebird server on local or remote machine before using
    FlameRobin. See package firebird3.0-server.
