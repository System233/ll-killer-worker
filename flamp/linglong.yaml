    ham radio Amateur Multicast Protocol application
    FLAMP is a program for AMP or Amateur Multicast Protocol. An FLAMP session
    will transmit one or more files with one or more iterations of the
    transmission. Each file is broken into blocks, each of which has a check sum.
    The receiving station saves the blocks that pass check sum. Successive
    transmissions will fill in the missing blocks provided that the new blocks
    pass the check sum. After the transmission sequence, the entire file is
    assembled and may be saved. “Fills” may be provided by retransmitting the
    entire file or by the sending station only sending the missing blocks.
