    game engine for single-player 2D action role-playing games
    Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built to
    handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs. Flare is not
    a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and
    exploration of the action RPG genre.

    Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the game
    data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats are
    preferred (png, ogg). The game code is C++.

    This package contains the game engine and you will need a game
    package (such as flare or polymorph) to play.
