    classic 2D point and click fantasy adventure game
    Flight of the Amazon Queen is a 2D point-and-click adventure game set
    in the 1940s, originally published for DOS and the Amiga.

    You assume the role of Joe King, a pilot for hire who is given the job
    of flying Faye Russell (a famous movie star) into the Amazon jungle for
    a photo shoot. Of course, things never go according to plans. After an
    unfortunate turn of events they find themselves stranded in the heart
    of the Amazon jungle, where Joe will embark on a quest to rescue a
    kidnapped princess and in the process, discover the true sinister
    intentions of a suspiciously located Lederhosen company. In a rich 2D
    environment, Joe will cross paths with a variety of unlikely jungle
    inhabitants including, but not limited to, a tribe of Amazon women and
    6-foot-tall pygmies.
