    Fast Light Toolkit - user interface designer
    This package provides Fluid, an interactive GUI designer for FLTK,
    allowing graphical development of FLTK-based user
    interfaces. It natively works with (textual) .fl files, but also
    includes rough support for reading .fd files produced by fdesign (in
    libforms-bin).

    The Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) is a cross-platform graphical user interface
    toolkit originally based on libForms.
