    Fullscreen distraction-free writing program
    Focuswriter is a fullscreen writing program designed to be
    distraction free.  You can customize your environment by changing the
    font, colors, and background image to add ambiance.  FocusWriter
    features an on-the-fly updating wordcount, optional auto-save,
    optional daily goals, and toolbars that hide away to allow you to
    focus more clearly.  Additionally, when you open the program your
    current work in progress will automatically load and position you at
    the end of your document, so that you can immediately jump back in.
