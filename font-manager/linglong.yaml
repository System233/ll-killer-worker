    font management application for the GNOME desktop
    Font Manager is intended to provide a way for average users to easily manage
    desktop fonts, without having to resort to command line tools or editing
    configuration files by hand. While designed primarily with the GNOME Desktop
    Environment in mind, it should work well with other Gtk+ desktop environments.
