    featureful personal font manager
    This is a manager built with the kind of features and abilities
    graphic designers, layout professionals along with others have felt
    necessary, but modernized with some new touches.

    Fontmatrix has a concept of 'tagging'. This makes it really nice to group
    fonts and even sub-group them logically for use in a book for instance.
    It also has extensive gui support for showing all glyphs in a font,
    previews of sample text, variable sizing and also tells what kinds of
    advanced Open Type features are inside each font. These features have
    never been seen outside of a font editor. And not least, it creates a
    nice PDF catalogue of user's fonts for printing or reference. In short,
    fontmatrix is a font manager for professionals, but is nice and user
    friendly.
