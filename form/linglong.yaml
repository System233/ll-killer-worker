    Symbolic manipulation system
    This is a Symbolic Manipulation System. It reads symbolic expressions from
    files and executes symbolic/algebraic transformations upon them. The answers
    are returned in a textual mathematical representation. As its landmark
    feature, the size of the considered expressions in FORM is only limited by
    the available disk space and not by the available RAM.
