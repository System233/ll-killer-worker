    Fast, advanced fractal generator
    FractalNow provides users with tools to generate pictures of various types of
    fractals quickly and easily.

    It is made of both a command line (FractalNow) and a graphical tool
    (QFractalNow).

    The graphical tool, based on Qt library, allows users to explore fractals
    intuitively and generate pictures.

    Both tools are entirely multi-threaded and implement advanced algorithms and
    heuristics that make computation very fast compared to most existing free
    fractal generators.
