    Civilization turn based strategy game (miscellaneous extras)
    Freeciv is a free clone of the turn based strategy game Civilization.
    In this game, each player becomes leader of a civilisation, fighting to
    obtain the ultimate goal: the extinction of all other civilisations.

    This package includes Freeciv's modpack tool freeciv-mp-gtk3. It allows you to
    select and download custom rulesets and tilesets for the game.
