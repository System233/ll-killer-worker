    Civilization turn based strategy game (GTK 3 client)
    Freeciv is a free clone of the turn based strategy game Civilization.
    In this game, each player becomes leader of a civilisation, fighting to
    obtain the ultimate goal: the extinction of all other civilisations.

    This is the GTK 3 version of Freeciv. It is the most sophisticated and
    recommended client to play the game.
