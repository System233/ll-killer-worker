    Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda,
    made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humor, it includes the actual game
    editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called
    Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.

    DFArc2 makes it easy to play and manage the Dink Smallwood game and
    its numerous D-Mods.
