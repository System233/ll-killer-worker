    humorous top-down adventure and role-playing game (engine)
    Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to classic
    Zelda, made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humor, it includes the actual
    game editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures
    called Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.

    GNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which
    runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close
    compatibility, under multiple platforms.

    This package contains the game engine alone.
