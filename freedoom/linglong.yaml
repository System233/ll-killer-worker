    two single player campaigns for Doom-compatible engines
    The Freedoom project aims to produce three base-game data files
    (IWADs) for Doom-compatible engines.  With it comes the
    capability to also play the wide range of mods created for Doom
    by a vibrant community.

    Freedoom: Phase 1 contains four chapters, nine levels each, to
    provide a smoothly-paced first person action game.  In it is a
    wide variety of mazes and enemies to fight and challenge your
    reflexes.

    Freedoom: Phase 2 is a 32-level game, expanding upon Phase 1 and
    adding a double-barrelled shotgun and more enemy types, along
    with even more brutal gameplay to really test your limits.

    Freedoom: Phase 1 is fully compatible with The Ultimate Doom mods.
    Freedoom: Phase 2 is fully compatible with Doom II and Final Doom mods.
