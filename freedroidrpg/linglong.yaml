    Isometric RPG influenced by Paradroid
    Freedroid RPG is an RPG with isometric graphics. In it, the player
    is Tux, who must fight rebelling robots in order to restore peace to
    humankind. To do so, Tux may take over robots in a minigame based off the
    classic game Paradroid, or may simply blast them to pieces with a weapon.

    Note that this is not the same game as Freedroid, also available in Debian.
