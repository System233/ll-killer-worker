    Digital Voice mode for ham radio
    FreeDV is a digital voice mode intended for transmission and
    reception over high-frequency (HF) radio. It uses a frequency
    division multiplex (FDM) modem with 15 carriers and no forward error
    correction (FEC). A low bit-rate voice coder-decoder (Codec 2)
    provides voice quality without the listener fatigue caused by noise
    and interference normally associated with analog single sideband
    (SSB) voice. A HF SSB transceiver, personal computer and two sound
    cards are required. Path simulation and on-the-air HF testing have
    shown that decoding voice is possible at a signal-to-noise ratio of
    4 dB.

    The FreeDV software was developed by David Rowe (Codec 2, FDM
    modem implementation, integration) and David Witten (GUI,
    architecture design). The FreeDV design and user interface was based
    on the earlier FDMDV program which was developed by Francesco
    Lanza. The FDM modem design and development was supported from Peter
    Martinez.
