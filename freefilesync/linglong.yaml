    Cross-platform file sync utility with GUI (GPL release)
    FreeFileSync is a folder comparison and synchronization software that
    creates and manages backup copies of all your important files. Instead
    of copying every file every time, FreeFileSync determines the
    differences between a source and a target folder and transfers only the
    minimum amount of data needed. FreeFileSync is Open Source software,
    available for Windows, Linux and macOS.

    This is the "GPL release" which uses the sources as published by the author,
    as opposed to the "FreeFileSync Donation Edition".
