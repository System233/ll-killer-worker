    GUI launcher for the Freespace 2 Source Code Project.

    FreeSpace is a series of space combat simulation games developed
    by Volition, Inc. and published by Interplay Entertainment.
    The games take place in the 24th century. Mankind, referred to as
    Terrans, has developed means for space traveling, further fueled
    by the discovery of subspace which makes interstellar travel not
    only possible but also fast and easy. As a result the Terrans have
    expanded their territory, eventually encountering another bipedal,
    sentient species; the Vasudans. However, due to cultural differences
    and difficulties in communicating with each other, the Galactic Terran
    Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE) end up fighting
    a war that lasts for 14 years.

    Original game files from CD are needed to play this game.
