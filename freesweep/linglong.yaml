    text-based minesweeper
    Freesweep is an implementation of the popular minesweeper game, where
    one tries to find all the mines without igniting any, based on hints given
    by the computer.  Unlike most implementations of this game, Freesweep
    works in any visual text display - in Linux console, in an xterm, and in
    most text-based terminals currently in use.
