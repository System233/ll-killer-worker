    Easy-to-use electronic design software
    Fritzing is an open source project designed to help one transition from a
    prototype to a finished project. Aimed at users who want to produce or document
    circuits and experiments, one starts by building a physical prototype, then
    recreating it with Fritzingâ€™s graphical editor. From there one can generate a
    schematic, PCB artwork, and PCB production files.
