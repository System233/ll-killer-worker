    Tool for viewing and editing FITS format files
    Fv provides a graphical user interface to data stored in FITS
    (Flexible Image Transport System) files.  Local files can be created,
    viewed and edited, files on the internet can be opened read-only
    through the http and ftp protocols. Through the POWplot program,
    FITS data can be visualized in a large variety of styles.  An
    interface to the SkyView online database allows for searching,
    downloading, and plotting of images and object lists for a region of
    the sky.
