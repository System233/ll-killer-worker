  description: |-
    File transfer protocol application for GNUstep
    This is a file transfer application (RFC 765) featuring a compact and easy
    interface. As most applications in GAP it tries to work on both GNUstep and
    MacOS X and retain the utmost possible similarity among the two version to
    ease working in both environments.

    FTP supports different port arbitration modes: "default", standard "PORT"
    (also known as active) and standard "PASV" (also known as passive).
