    "Those Funny Funguloids!" is actually a nice little piece of entertainment.
    You collect mushrooms, bring them back to your home base and profit! That's
    the basic idea in a nutshell. It has smooth, appealing 3d graphics and nice
    atmospheric sound effects. Go ahead and try it out - it has sounds too!
