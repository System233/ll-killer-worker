    Firewall administration tool GUI
    Firewall Builder consists of an object-oriented GUI and a set of policy
    compilers for various firewall platforms. In Firewall Builder, firewall
    policy is a set of rules, each rule consists of abstract objects which
    represent real network objects and services (hosts, routers, firewalls,
    networks, protocols). Firewall Builder helps the user maintain a database
    of objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop operations.

    This is the GUI part of fwbuilder
