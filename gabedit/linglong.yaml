    graphical user interface to Ab Initio packages
    Gabedit is a graphical user interface to computational chemistry
    packages like:

    - MPQC
    - GAMESS-US
    - Gaussian
    - Molcas
    - Molpro
    - Q-Chem

    These Ab Initio software packages might run locally or on a remote
    server (supporting FTP, RSH and SSH). Gabedit can display a variety
    of calculation results including most major molecular file formats.
    The advanced "Molecule Builder" allows one to rapidly sketch in
    molecules and examine them in 3D. Graphics can further be exported
    to various formats, including animations.

    slurm-wlm-torque and gridengine-client are workload managers which
    provide wrappers for PBS commands. Gabedit also allows one to
    configure it for any other workload manager.
