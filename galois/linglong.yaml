    falling blocks game with blocks of various shapes and sizes
    Galois is a computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with
    unique features. Unlike most other games of that type, it is not
    limited to blocks made of four two-dimensional, square bricks: you
    can choose among several different brick shapes, blocks composed of
    more or fewer bricks, and even between two- and three-dimensional
    games.
