    Launcher for proprietary games
    Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
    and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
    different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
    in Debian but the data cannot.

    Some of the games supported by game-data-packager need to be
    started by a special launcher script that will create symbolic
    links or do other setup. This package contains those launcher
    scripts.

    The following games currently require this package:

    * Doom 2: The Master Levels (doom2-masterlevels-wad)
    * Quake series and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars
    (quake, quake2, quake3, quake4, etqw)
    * Return to Castle Wolfenstein (rtcw)
    * Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy
    (openjk-outcast, openjk-academy)
    * Unreal, Unreal Gold and Unreal Tournament
    (unreal-classic, unreal-gold, ut99)
