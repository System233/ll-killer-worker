    locate and modify a variable in a running process (GUI)
    GameConqueror is a GUI based on Python and GTK+ using scanmem to locate
    the address of a variable in a running process. This can be used for the
    analysis or modification of a hostile process on a compromised machine, for
    reverse engineering, or as a "pokefinder" to cheat at video games.

    GameConqueror provides a CheatEngine-alike user-friendly interface with more
    features than scanmem.
