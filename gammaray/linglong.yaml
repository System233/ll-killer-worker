    Tool for examining the internals of Qt application
    GammaRay is a tool for examining the internals of a Qt application and
    to some extent also manipulate it. GammaRay uses injection methods to
    hook into an application at runtime and provide access to a wide variety
    of interesting information. It provides easy ways of navigating through
    the complex internal structures you find in some Qt frameworks, such as
    QGraphicsView, model/view, QTextDocument, state machines and more.
