    Adjust display hue to outside lighting conditions
    Gammastep automatically adjusts the color temperature of computer
    displays to help reduce the eye strain that comes with working in
    low-light conditions.

    Based on the geographical location of the computer system, Gammastep
    will keep the screen at the default bluish hue during daytime but
    adjust to an orange or reddish color in the evening hours and
    nighttime.
