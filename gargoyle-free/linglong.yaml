    graphical player for Interactive Fiction games
    Gargoyle is an Interactive Fiction (text adventure) player that
    supports all the major interactive fiction formats.

    Most interactive fiction is distributed as portable game files. These
    portable game files come in many formats. In the past, you used to
    have to download a separate player (interpreter) for each format of
    IF you wanted to play. Instead, Gargoyle provides unified player.

    Gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it
    supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys),
    *.agx/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl/.cas (Quest games, played
    with Geas), .jacl/.j2 (JACL), .l9/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic),
    *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam/.t3 (TADS),
    *.z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with
    Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (Inform or
    Supergl√∫s games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played
    with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb
    archives, played with Frotz).

    (note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or
    the GNU Interactive Tools)

    Gargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.

    Technically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to
    manage I/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle
    provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and
    images in a graphical Qt window, with care on typography.

    Limitations:

    * While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a
    way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.

    * The TADS interpreter doesn't support HTML TADS; you can play
    the games, but will miss the hyperlinks.
