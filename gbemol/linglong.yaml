    Graphical frontend for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
    gbemol allows you to use MPD with a userfriendly interface. Features include
    an easy-to-use, tag-oriented library browser, a two mode playlist, cover art
    support (APIC tag only, for now), system tray icon docking, song, album and
    artist information.

    Music Player Daemon is a server that allows remote access for playing audio
    files, streams and managing playlists. The daemon is controlled through a
    client which need not run on the same computer mpd runs on.
