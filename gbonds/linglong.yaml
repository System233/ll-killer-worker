    U.S. Savings Bond inventory program for GNOME
    GBonds is a U.S. Savings Bond inventory program for the GNOME desktop
    environment.  It allows you to track the current redemption value and
    performance of your U.S. Savings Bonds and keep a valuable record of the
    bonds you own.

    Features:

    * Tracks savings notes and series E, EE, and I savings bonds.
    * Uses U.S. Treasury Department redemption files without modification.
    * Imports inventories created with Savings Bond Wizard.
    * Tracks current value of both individual bonds and an entire inventory.
    * Prints inventories.  It is important to keep a permanent record of your
    bonds in a separate location in case you ever need to replace them.
