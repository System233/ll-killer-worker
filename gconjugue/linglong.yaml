    GTK+ program to conjugate Brazilian verbs
    Graphical program to conjugate Portuguese verbs as spoken in Brazil.

    If the entered expression is not a verb, GConjugue tries to find it
    among the conjugated forms of known verbs. It also has the option of
    conjugating verbs as ordinary Brazilians do. In fact, Brazilians of
    different regions deviate from the normative grammar in different ways,
    but the conjugation displayed will already help foreigners to grasp
    what Brazilians are saying.

    This program is a graphical interface. Alternatively, you can use
    conjugar, the text only version for gconjugue.
