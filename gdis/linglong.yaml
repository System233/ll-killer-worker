    molecular and crystal model viewer
    A GTK+ based program for the display and manipulation of
    isolated molecules, periodic systems and crystalline habits.
    It is in development, but is nonetheless fairly functional.
    It has the following features:

    * Support for several file types (CIF, BIOSYM, XYZ,
    XTL, MARVIN, and GULP)
    * A simple molecular creation and manipulation tool
    * A dialogue for creating starting configurations for
    molecular dynamics simulations
    * Assorted tools for visualization (geometry information,
    region highlighting, etc.)
    * Animation of BIOSYM files (also rendered animations,
    see below)

    GDIS also allows you to perform the following functions
    through other packages:

    * Model rendering (courtesy of POVRay)
    * Energy minimization (courtesy of GULP)
    * Morphology calculation (courtesy of cdd)
    * Space group processing (courtesy of SgInfo)
    * View the Periodic Table (courtesy of GPeriodic)
    * Load additional filetypes, such as PDB (courtesy of Babel)
