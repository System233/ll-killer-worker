    GNOME Display Manager
    GDM provides the equivalent of a "login:" prompt for X displays: it
    asks for a login and starts graphical sessions.

    It supports multiple seats and switching between multiple users.

    The greeter is based on the GNOME libraries and applications, and its
    look and design are the same as those of a GNOME session.
