    Tool to visualize diskspace
    GdMap is a tool which allows you to visualize disk space. Ever
    wondered why your hard disk is full or what directory and files take
    up most of the space? With GdMap these questions can be answered
    quickly. To display directory structures cushion treemaps are used
    which visualize a complete folder or even the whole hard drive with
    one picture.
