    fast and lightweight IDE
    Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
    It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
    few dependencies from other packages. It is using only the GTK3 toolkit
    and therefore you need only the GTK3 runtime libraries to run Geany.

    The basic features of Geany are:
    - syntax highlighting
    - code completion
    - auto completion of constructs like if, for and while, XML and HTML
    - call tips
    - folding
    - many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal
    - symbol lists
    - embedded terminal emulation
