    roguelike mecha role playing game in space
    Set a century and a half after nuclear war, you can explore a world
    where various factions compete to determine the future of the human
    race. Major features include random plot generation, a detailed
    character system, and over two hundred customizable mecha designs.

    GearHead 2 is set five years after the events of GearHead 1. It is
    currently under development and is initially set in the L5 Orbital
    Pattern.

    This is the SDL version.  For the console version, use gearhead
    instead.
