    popular text editor for the GNOME desktop environment
    gedit is a text editor which supports most standard editor features,
    extending this basic functionality with other features not usually
    found in simple text editors. gedit is a graphical application which
    supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as
    tabs or MDI).

    gedit fully supports international text through its use of the Unicode
    UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature set includes syntax
    highlighting of source code, auto indentation and printing and print preview
    support.

    gedit is also extensible through its plugin system, which currently
    includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS
    ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.
