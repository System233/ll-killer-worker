    Open-source engine to run Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment
    GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a new implementation
    of the original Infinity Engine (the one of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale,
    Planescape: Torment, ...) to Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows with some
    enhancements.

    It means that you either need some of the original game's data
    somewhere on your harddisk, or you can try to use the data from the
    Dragonlance Total Conversion project.

    The original game data has to be installed on a windows
    partition and mounted to your Linux/Unix filesystem, installed on
    windows and then copied to your filesystem, installed with WINE or
    extracted manually from the CDs using the tool `unshield'.

    Supported games: Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, Planescape:Torment.
