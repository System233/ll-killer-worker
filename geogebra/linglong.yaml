    Dynamic mathematics software for education
    GeoGebra is a dynamic geometry program. You can do constructions with points,
    vectors, segments, lines, conic sections as well as functions and change
    them dynamically afterwards. On the other hand, equations and coordinates
    can be entered directly.

    Support for many geometric constructions is provided, as well as support
    for many calculus-based tools (derivatives, osculating circle, ...).

    GeoGebra files can be exported in many different formats, or as interactive
    applets for web pages.
