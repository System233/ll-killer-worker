    interactive geometry viewing program
    Geomview is interactive geometry software which is
    particularly appropriate for mathematics research and education.
    In particular, geomview can display things in hyperbolic and
    spherical space as well as Euclidean space.

    Geomview allows multiple independently controllable objects and
    cameras.  It provides interactive control for motion, appearances
    (including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an
    object, edge or vertex level, snapshots in SGI image file or
    Renderman RIB format, and adding or deleting objects is provided
    through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard
    shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the
    viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or
    controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing
    interactive control of everything else.
