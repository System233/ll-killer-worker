    GEOgraphic coordinates TRANslator
    GEOTRANZ (Geographic Translator) is an application program which allows
    you to easily convert geographic coordinates among a wide variety of
    coordinate systems, map projections, and datums. Currently, twenty-five
    different coordinate systems, map projections, grids, and coding
    schemes, and over two hundred different datums, are supported.

    The user interface of GEOTRANZ is similar to that of a calculator, but
    can also be used to efficiently convert large numbers of coordinates
    contained in text files.

    GEOTRANZ is the Debian name of GEOTRANS, a product of the National
    Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and U.S. Army Engineering Research
    and Development Center.

    This package contains the geotranz java graphical interface.
