    UPnP MediaServer
    Gerbera is an UPnP MediaServer with a nice web user interface based on
    MediaTomb. It allows you to stream your digital media through your home
    network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP compatible devices.

    Gerbera implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can be found
    on http://www.upnp.org/. The current implementation focuses on parts that are
    required by the specification, however Gerbera's functionality is extended to
    cover the optional parts of the spec as well.
