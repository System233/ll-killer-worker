    Data visualization system for high-dimensional data
    GGobi is an open source visualization program for exploring
    high-dimensional data. It provides highly dynamic and interactive
    graphics such as tours, as well as familiar graphics such as the
    scatterplot, barchart and parallel coordinates plots. Plots are
    interactive and linked with brushing and identification.

    See http://www.ggobi.org for more information.
