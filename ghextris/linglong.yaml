    Tetris-like game on a hexagonal grid
    The object of the game is basically the same as in Tetris; use the
    pieces that fall down from the top of the game area to construct
    fully filled lines, which will then disappear to make room for more
    pieces. The twist is that the pieces are composed of hexagonal
    blocks, so your visualization skills will get an extra workout.
