    Distraction-free, themeable Markdown editor
    ghostwriter is a Markdown editor that provides a themable,
    distraction-free writing environment, along with a live HTML
    preview as you type, easy document navigation with an outline HUD,
    and export to popular document formats with Sundown, Pandoc,
    MultiMarkdown, Discount, cmark, or cmark-gfm processors.  It also
    features a live word count and auto-save. Eliminate distractions in
    fullscreen mode, or concentrate on the current text you are writing
    in focus mode.  It even remembers your last opened file and position
    within the file, so you can pick up where you last left off.
