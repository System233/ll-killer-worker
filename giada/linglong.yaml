    Hardcore Loop Machine
    free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for DJs, live performers and electronic
    musicians. Pick up your channel, fill it with samples or MIDI events and start
    the show by using this tiny piece of software as a loop machine, drum machine,
    sequencer, live sampler or yet as a plugin/effect host.

    Giada aims to be a compact and portable virtual device for production use and
    live sets.
