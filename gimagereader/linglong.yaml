    Graphical GTK+ front-end to tesseract-ocr
    gImageReader is a simple front-end to tesseract-ocr. Tesseract is probably
    the most accurate open source optical character recognition (OCR) software and
    can recognize text in over 60 languages.

    gImageReader supports automatic page layout detection but the user can also
    manually define and adjust the recognition regions. It is possible to import
    images from disk, scanning devices, clipboard and screenshots. gImageReader
    also supports multipage PDF documents. Recognized text is displayed directly
    next to the image and basic text editing including search/replace and removing
    of line breaks is possible. Spellchecking for the output text is also supported
    if the corresponding dictionaries are installed.

    This package contains the GTK+ variant of gImageReader.
