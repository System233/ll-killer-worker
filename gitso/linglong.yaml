    simple frontend for reverse VNC connections (remote assistance)
    Gitso is a cross-platform (Linux, OS X and Windows) graphical program to
    easily connect one person to another person's screen, keyboard and mouse.
    This makes it straight-forward to get help or give technical support.

    In a simple two-step process, the person giving support first sets up port
    forwarding and firewalling on his end, if necessary, and starts Gitso to
    listen for incoming connections on port 5500. Then, the person looking for
    help uses Gitso to connect to the supporter's address (IP or domain name),
    making their screen remotely visible and allowing the supporter to use their
    keyboard and mouse.
