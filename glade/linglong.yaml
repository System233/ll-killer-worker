    GTK+ User Interface Builder
    Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of user
    interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit.

    The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in the well-known
    XML format, enabling easy integration with external tools. You will
    probably want to use it with tools such as GtkBuilder, which can load
    the XML files and create the interfaces at runtime.

    This version is more modular than previous ones, so you can install
    modules to add additional widgets for Glade to use.
