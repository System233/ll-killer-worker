    minimalist audio encoder GUI for generating live streams
    GlassCoder is a minimalist audio encoder for IceCase and Soutcase
    streaming servers as well as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). It supports
    the following audio sources:

    Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)
    File Streaming (FILE)
    JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK)

    The base GlassCoder streamer component utilizes no configuration files or
    GUI interface whatsoever; with the 'user interface' consisting entirely of
    the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well suited for use cases where
    the encoder is completely driven by an external system or script.

    The following audio codecs are supported:

    MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 3 ('MP3')
    Ogg Opus
    Ogg Vorbis
    PCM16

    This package contains GlassGui, a graphical point-and-click interface that
    can be used to drive GlassCoder or generate command-line invocations that
    can be copy/pasted to other systems
