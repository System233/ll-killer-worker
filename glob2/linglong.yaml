    innovative Real Time Strategy game
    Globulation 2 is an ongoing, multi-platform project to create innovative
    high-quality RTS gameplay, minimizing micro-management and assigning tasks
    to the units automatically. You just have to order the number of units you
    want for a selected task and the units will do their best to satisfy your
    requirements.

    Glob2 can be played by a single player, through your Local Area Network,
    or over the Internet, thanks to the Ysagoon Online Gaming meta-server. It
    also features a scripting language for versatile gameplay and an integrated
    map editor.
