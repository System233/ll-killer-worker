    Smart interactive log explorer using Qt
    glogg is a multi-platform GUI application to browse and search through long or
    complex log files. It is designed with programmers and system administrators
    in mind and can be seen as a graphical, interactive combination of grep and
    less.

    Main features include:
    * Accept egrep regular expression to search or filter the log.
    * Interactively display results of the search in a second, filtered window.
    * Colorize the log and the search results.
    * Read the file directly from disk, without loading it into memory.
    * Happily handle big (>4 GiB) files.
    * Read UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded files.
    * Follow a log in real-time as it is written to disk.
    * Allow one to insert marks in the logs to interesting lines.
    * Support less/vim like keyboard commands to move around the file.
