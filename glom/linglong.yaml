    database designer and user interface
    With Glom you can design table definitions and the relationships between
    them, plus arrange the fields on the screen. You can edit and search the
    data in those tables, and specify field values in terms of other fields.
    It's as easy as it should be.

    The design is loosely based on FileMaker Pro, with the added advantage of
    separation between interface and data. Its simple framework should be enough
    to implement most database applications. Without Glom these systems normally
    consist of lots of repetitive, unmaintainable code.
