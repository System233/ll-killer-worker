    Glue is a Python project to link visualizations of scientific datasets across
    many files. Some of its features are:

    * Interactive, linked statistical graphics of multiple files.
    * Support for many file formats including common image formats,
    ascii tables, astronomical image and table formats (fits, vot, ipac), and
    HDF5. Custom data loaders can also be easily added.
    * Highly scriptable and extendable.
