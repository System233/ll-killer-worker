    multiformat media player
    Gmerlin is a multiformat media player with tree-like virtual directory
    structure, where you can save your files, webstreams or whatever. It
    handles even large media collections gracefully. Hardware devices appear
    also in the tree so you can open Audio-CDs, (S)VCDs, DVDs and
    DVB-broadcasts.
