    Three-dimensional finite element mesh generator
    Gmsh is a 3D finite element grid generator with a build-in CAD engine
    and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and
    user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced
    visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry,
    mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to
    these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user
    interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.

    See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's
    capabilities.
