    figure out which letters are which numbers
    Multiplication Puzzle is a simple GTK 4 game that emulates the
    multiplication game found in Emacs.  Basically, a multiplication
    problem is shown with all digits replaced by letters.  Your job
    is to guess which letter represents which number.
