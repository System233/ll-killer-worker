    program that tries to learn a human language
    gNiall attempts to learn whatever language you try to teach it. It is
    basically a dissociator: it collects statistics on sentences you type
    and tries to construct meaningful replies. gNiall is inspired by Niall,
    an Amiga program by Matthew Peck.
