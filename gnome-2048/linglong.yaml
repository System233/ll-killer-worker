    sliding tile puzzle game
    GNOME 2048 is a clone of Gabriele Cirulli's 2048, a puzzle game based on
    Veewo Studios' 1024.

    Move the sliding tiles with one of the four arrow keys on your keyboard.
    When two tiles with the same number touch, they combine into a single tile
    and the numbers are added together.
