    Simple GNOME app to access virtual systems
    GNOME Boxes is a desktop client to view or use local virtual machines.
    Boxes is intentionally simple and easy to use.

    Hardware virtualization is required.

    Previously, GNOME Boxes could also be used to connect to remote computers,
    but that feature is now provided by the GNOME Connections app.
