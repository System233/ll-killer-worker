    Simple GNOME app to access remote computers
    GNOME Connections is a desktop client to view or use remote computers
    using VNC or RDP. The app is intentionally simple and easy to use.

    GNOME Connections replaces the remote desktop functionality that was
    previously found in GNOME Boxes.
