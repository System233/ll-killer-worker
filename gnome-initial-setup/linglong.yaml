    Initial GNOME system setup helper
    After acquiring or installing a new system there are a few essential things
    to set up before use. GNOME Initial Setup aims to provide a simple, easy,
    and safe way to prepare a new system.

    GNOME Initial Setup runs the first time you log in to the GNOME desktop
    and lets you easily configure your language, keyboard layout, online accounts
    integration, and more.

    If you want to configure these things at any other time, run the Settings app.
