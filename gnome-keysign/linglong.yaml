    easy signing of OpenPGP keys over the local network
    GNOME Keysign is a tool for signing OpenPGP keys.

    Its purpose is to ease signing other peoples' keys. It is similar to caff,
    PIUS, or monkeysign. In fact, it is influenced a lot by these tools and
    either reimplements ideas or reuses code. Consider either of the above
    mentioned tools when you need a much more mature codebase.

    In contrast to caff or monkeysign, this tool enables you to sign a key
    without contacting a key server. It downloads an authenticated copy of the
    key from the other party. For now, the key is authenticated by its fingerprint
    which is securely transferred via a QR code. Alternatively, the user may type
    the fingerprint manually, assuming that it has been transferred securely via
    the audible channel.

    After having obtained an authentic copy of the key, its UIDs are signed. The
    signatures are then encrypted and sent via email. In contrast to monkeysign,
    xdg-email is used to pop up a pre-filled email composer windows of the mail
    client the user has configured to use. This greatly reduces complexity as no
    SMTP configuration needs to be obtained and gives the user a well known
    interface.
