    mutter based compositor for kiosks
    GNOME Kiosk provides a desktop environment suitable for fixed purpose, or
    single application deployments like wall displays and point-of-sale systems.

    It provides a very minimal wayland display server and compositor and Xorg
    compositor and window manager. It automatically starts applications fullscreen.

    Notably, GNOME Kiosk features no panels, dashes, or docks that could distract
    from the application using it as a platform.
