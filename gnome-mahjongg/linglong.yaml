    classic Eastern tile game for GNOME
    This is a solitaire (one player) version of the classic Eastern tile
    game, Mahjongg.

    You start with five levels of tiles which are stacked so some are
    covered up by the tiles on top. The object of Mahjongg is to remove all
    the tiles from the game, by finding matching pairs which look alike.
