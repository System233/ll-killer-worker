    Mastermindâ„¢ clone for GNOME
    The goal of this board game is to break a code using obscure hints.
    The game is played by 2 players: the codemaker (the computer) and the
    codebreaker.  The computer generates a combination of 4 colors.  The
    codebreaker has to guess that pattern (both order and colors) with
    the least number of tries.  At each turn, the codebreaker tries a
    pattern and the computer provides feedback by placing pegs in the
    score grid.  A white peg indicates a right color but wrong position;
    a colored peg means that both color and position are correctly
    guessed.
