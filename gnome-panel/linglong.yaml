    traditional panel, used in GNOME Flashback
    GNOME Flashback continues the traditional desktop interface which was used
    in GNOME 2.x, but using modern GNOME technologies.

    GNOME Panel is a part of the GNOME Flashback desktop, and provides panels
    and default applets for the desktop. A panel is a horizontal or vertical
    bar that can be added to a screen margin. It can contain various applets,
    such as the menu bar, application launch icons, the clock, volume controls,
    and displays for network connectivity, battery level, and other system
    monitors.
