    visual application launcher for GNOME
    gnome-pie is a radial visual application launcher for GNOME. It allows the
    user to bind groups of frequently used applications to a ring that appears
    when a hot key / mouse binding is triggered.

    It was inspired by the OPie addon written for the game World of Warcraft.
