    power management tool for the GNOME desktop
    GNOME Power Manager is a session daemon for the GNOME desktop
    that takes care of system or desktop events related to power, and
    triggers actions accordingly. Its philosophy is to completely hide
    these complex tasks and only show some settings important to the user.

    GNOME power manager displays and manages battery status, power plug
    events, display brightness, CPU, graphics card and hard disk drive
    power saving, and can trigger suspend-to-RAM, hibernate or shutdown
    events, all integrated to other components of the GNOME desktop.
