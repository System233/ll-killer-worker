    Screensaver and screen lock formerly used in GNOME
    gnome-screensaver is a simple screen saver and screen lock, used in older
    versions of the GNOME desktop environment.

    It is designed to support, among other things:

    * the ability to lock down configuration settings
    * translation into other languages
    * user switching

    This package is not necessary in the GNOME desktop environment, because
    GNOME Shell contains its own screen lock implementation. It can be
    used with alternative desktop environments.
