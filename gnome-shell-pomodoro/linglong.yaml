    GNOME Shell time-management app
    This GNOME Shell app helps you to manage time according to the
    pomodoro technique.

    Features:
    * puts a countdown timer in the GNOME Shell top panel;
    * nags you with reminders about taking a break;
    * uses full screen notifications that can be easily dismissed;
    * hides other notifications until the start of the break;
    * sets your IM (Empathy) status to "busy".

    The pomodoro technique is a time and focus management method which improves
    productivity and quality of work. The name comes from a kitchen timer, which
    can be used to keep track of time. In short, you are supposed to focus on work
    for around 25 minutes and then have a well deserved break in which you should
    relax. Then when this cycle repeats for the fourth time you should take a
    longer break (have a walk or something).
