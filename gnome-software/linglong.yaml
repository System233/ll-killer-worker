    Software lets you install and update applications and system extensions.

    Software uses a plugin architecture to separate the frontend from the
    technologies that are used underneath. Currently, a PackageKit plugin provides
    data from a number of traditional packaging systems, such as rpm or apt. An
    appdata plugin provides additional metadata from locally installed data in the
    appdata format.
