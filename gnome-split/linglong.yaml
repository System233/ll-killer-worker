    GNOME Split - File splitter for GNOME desktop
    Tool that allows you to split files and merge them back. It is written in Java
    and uses a GTK+ user interface (thanks to the java-gnome project). The goal is
    to offer a native implementation of similar projects which can handle multiple
    file formats (e.g. Xtremsplit).
