    These System Tools (known as GNOME System Tools) are a set of tools aimed to
    make easy the job that means the computer administration on an UNIX or Linux
    system. They're thought to help from the new Linux or UNIX user to the system
    administrators.

    Its main advantages are:
    * An user-friendly interface to carry out the main administration tasks.
    * The use of a common user interface in every system.
    * A common structure that makes easy the development of new system tools.

    - Users and groups
    - Date and time
