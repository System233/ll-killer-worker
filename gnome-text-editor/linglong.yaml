    simple text editor for GNOME
    GNOME Text Editor is a simple editor for GNOME focused on being a good
    general purpose default editor.

    It works hard to keep track of changes and state even if you quit the
    application. You can come back to your work even if you've never saved
    it to a file.

    It is simpler than gedit.
