    Simple MAME frontend
    GNOME Video Arcade is a simple MAME frontend for the GNOME desktop.
    Its goal is not providing a UI for the many options MAME supports, or
    helping manage a ROM collection: the focus is on a clean interface that
    allows quick search and launch of games, thanks to the use of tags.
