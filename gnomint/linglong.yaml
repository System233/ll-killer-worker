    X.509 Certification Authority management tool for GNOME
    gnoMint is a tool for easily creating and managing certification authorities.
    It provides fancy visualization of all the pieces of information that pertain
    to a CA, such as X.509 certificates, CSRs, and CRLs.

    gnoMint is currently capable of managing a CA that emits certificates that are
    able to authenticate people or machines in VPNs (IPSec or other protocols),
    secure HTTP communications with SSL/TLS, authenticate and cipher HTTP
    communications through Web-client certificates, and sign or crypt email
    messages.
