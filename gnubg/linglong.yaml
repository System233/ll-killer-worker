    graphical or console backgammon program with analysis
    GNU Backgammon is a strong backgammon program (world-class with a bearoff
    database installed) usable either as an engine by other programs or as a
    standalone backgammon game.  In addition to supporting simple play, it
    also has extensive analysis features, a tutor mode, adjustable
    difficulty, and support for exporting annotated games.  It can be played
    either from a GTK+ graphical interface, optionally with a 3D board, or
    from a simple text console.
