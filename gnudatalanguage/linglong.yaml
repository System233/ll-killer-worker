    Free IDL compatible incremental compiler
    GNU Data Language (GDL) is a free IDL (Interactive Data Language)
    compatible incremental compiler. It has full syntax compatibility
    with IDL 7.1. IDL is a registered trademark of ITT Visual Information
    Solutions. From IDL 8.0, the following language elements are
    supported:

    * FOREACH loop
    * negative array indices
    * garbage collection pointers and objects
    * call methods on an object using "." (e. g. `object.aMemberProcedure,arg1`)

    The file input output system is fully implemented. GUI support (widgets) is
    officially provided, but it's not complete yet.

    This package contains the main commandline and interpreter frontend.
