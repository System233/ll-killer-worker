    medical practice management - Client
    This is the GNUmed Electronic Medical Record. Its purpose is
    to enable doctors to keep a medically sound record on their
    patients' health. It does not currently provide functionality
    for stock keeping. Clinical features are well-tested by real
    doctors in the field.

    While the GNUmed team has taken the utmost care to make sure
    the medical records are safe at all times you still need to
    make sure you are taking appropriate steps to backup the
    medical data to a safe place at appropriate intervals. Do
    not forget to test your recovery procedures, too !

    Protect your data! GNUmed itself comes without
    any warranty whatsoever. You have been warned.

    This package contains the wxpython client.
