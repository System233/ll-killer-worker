    GNU's framework for secure peer-to-peer networking (GTK+ client)
    GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does not use any
    centralized or otherwise trusted services. Its high-level goal is to provide a
    strong free software foundation for a global network that provides security
    and in particular respects privacy.

    This package contains the graphical client, using the GTK+ toolkit. In order
    use GNUnet, you also need gnunet either on your server or on your local
    machine.
