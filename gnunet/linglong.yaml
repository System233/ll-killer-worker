    GNU's framework for secure peer-to-peer networking
    GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does not use any
    centralized or otherwise trusted services. Its high-level goal is to provide a
    strong free software foundation for a global network that provides security
    and in particular respects privacy.

    GNUnet started with an idea for anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing,
    but has grown to incorporate other applications as well as many generic
    building blocks for secure networking applications. In particular, GNUnet now
    includes the GNU Name System, a privacy-preserving, decentralized public key
    infrastructure.
