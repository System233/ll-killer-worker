    GNU Radio Software Radio Toolkit
    GNU Radio provides signal processing blocks to implement software
    radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF
    hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a
    simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic
    and commercial environments to support both wireless communications
    research and real-world radio systems.

    GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python
    programming language, while the supplied performance-critical signal
    processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point
    extensions, where available. Thus, the developer is able to implement
    real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use,
    rapid-application-development environment.

    While not primarily a simulation tool, GNU Radio does support
    development of signal processing algorithms using pre-recorded or
    generated data, avoiding the need for actual RF hardware.

    This package contains the gnuradio-companion, a graphical tool for
    creating signal flow graphs and generating flow-graph source code.
    Also included are a variety of tools and utility programs.
