    Allows you to attach to an already running Emacs
    gnuserv allows you to attach to an already running Emacs. This
    allows external programs to make use of Emacs' editing
    capabilities. It is similar to GNU Emacs' emacsclient, but
    has a slightly different feature set.

    You do not need this package if you use XEmacs; it already
    includes gnuserv and gnuclient. If you want to use gnuserv with
    both GNU Emacs and XEmacs, you will only be able to use the
    alternative /usr/bin/gnuclient with one flavor of emacs; you will
    have to use either gnuclient.xemacs or gnuclient.emacs for the
    other flavor.
