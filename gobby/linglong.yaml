    infinote-based collaborative text editor
    Gobby is an editor which allows one to edit text documents and source files
    collaboratively over a network. All users could work on the file
    simultaneously without the need to lock it. The parts the various users
    write are highlighted in different colours and it supports syntax
    highlighting of various programming and markup languages.

    Gobby is portable to both Windows and Unix-like platforms and makes use of
    the Gtk+ toolkit. A dedicated server is available in the infinoted package.
