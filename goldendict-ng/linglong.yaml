    feature-rich dictionary lookup program (NG/qtwebengine fork)
    GoldenDict is a feature-rich dictionary lookup program, supporting multiple
    dictionary formats (StarDict/Babylon/Lingvo/Dictd/AARD/MDict/SDict)
    and online dictionaries, featuring perfect article rendering with the
    complete markup, illustrations and other content retained,
    and allowing you to type in words without any accents or correct case.

    This is a forked version that uses QtWebEngine as rendering engine instead
    of QtWebKit.
