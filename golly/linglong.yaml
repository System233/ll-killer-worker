    Game of Life simulator using hashlife algorithm
    Golly simulates Conway's Game of Life with an arbitrarily large grid
    of cells.  It can optionally use a hashlife algorithm, which allows
    it to rapidly compute generations for huge patterns, and to compute
    many generations into the future at a time.

    Golly provides a graphical interface for viewing and editing cellular
    automata.  It supports copy and paste, zoom, auto-fit, multiple
    layers, and viewing different areas of a pattern simultaneously in
    different areas of a window.

    Golly can load patterns from RLE, Life 1.05/1.06, dblife, and
    macrocell file formats; it can also interpret images as Life
    patterns.  Golly provides integrated help, including a copy of the
    Life Lexicon.

    Golly also supports other rules for 2D cellular automata with an
    8-cell neighborhood, and supports 1D cellular automata.
