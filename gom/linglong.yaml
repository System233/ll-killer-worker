    Command line and interactive ncurses-based OSS audio mixer
    gom is a command line mixer utility with optional built-in ncurses
    interactive interface.

    Its main feature is an exhaustive command line interface that makes
    it ideal for scripting (e.g. for audio recording, running at user
    and/or system login time, setting/restoring of settings, etc).

    It supports OSS only, so if you want to use it with ALSA, you will
    need its OSS-compatible modules. If you want to use all possible
    features of ALSA however, you would need to use a mixer program
    dedicated for ALSA.
