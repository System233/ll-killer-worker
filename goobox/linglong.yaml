    CD player and ripper with GNOME 3 integration
    Goobox is an CD player and ripper for the GNOME 3 environment. It follows the
    "Just Works" principle so its interface is beautiful and easy-to-use.

    It uses GNOME/GTK+ for its user interface, GStreamer framework for CD playing,
    and ripping operations, musicbrainz for CD indexing, and Google to search
    for album cover images.
