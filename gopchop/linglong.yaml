    fast, lossless cuts-only editor for MPEG2 video files
    gopchop cuts and merges MPEG2 video streams. gopchop uses
    a method to cut streams that does not require re-encoding,
    and therefore is fast and not prone to the artifacts
    and degradation of quality inherent in re-encoding.
    However, cuts are limited to I-frames or
    group-of-picture (GOP) boundaries. These frames occur
    frequently enough, and often times at scene transitions,
    so that gopchop's method is adequate for many applications.

    The typical use is manually editing commercials out of
    recorded television programs.

    Another application is splitting .VOB files from
    dual-layer DVD rips so that the content can be
    re-authored such that each half will fit on one
    single-layer DVD recordable.
