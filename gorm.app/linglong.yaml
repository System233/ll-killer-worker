    Visual Interface Builder for GNUstep
    Gorm, the GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler, is a tool to build GUI
    interfaces for the GNUstep system.  It is a clone of the NeXTStep
    "Interface Builder" app. It works well with ProjectCenter to create
    GUI applications for GNUstep.

    You can create .nib files that also work on macOS and vice versa.
