    simple puzzle game involving untangling planar graphs
    gPlanarity is a puzzle game with the goal to untangle planar graphs for
    fun and prizes. If you tend to get addicted to cute little math  puzzles,
    this one is a doozy.

    gPlanarity is a super-clone of the flash Planarity game written by John
    Tantalo. The original Planarity ran well in IE and Firefox on other
    platforms, but was slow and liked to lock up or abort under Linux
    browsers.

    gPlanarity implements gameplay identical to the original Planarity but
    adds some UI and game extras around the basic game such as multiple
    board generation algorithms, puzzle boards, complete backing state,
    group select/drag and so on.
