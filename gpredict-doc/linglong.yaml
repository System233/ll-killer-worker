    Satellite tracking program - documentation
    Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program
    for the Linux desktop. It uses the SGP4/SDP4 propagation algorithms together
    with NORAD two-line element sets (TLE).

    Some core features of Gpredict include:

    * Tracking of a large number of satellites only limited by the physical
    memory and processing power of the computer
    * Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any combination
    of these
    * Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own
    windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode
    * You can use many ground stations
    * Predict upcoming passes
    * Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and
    backward), and manual time control
    * Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes
    * Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld
    * Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld

    This package contains the documentation and other architecture-independent
    files.
