    GPS file conversion plus transfer to/from GPS units - GUI
    GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to
    another, whether that format is a common mapping format like Delorme,
    Streets and Trips, or even a serial upload or download to a GPS unit
    such as those from Garmin and Magellan.

    This package contains gpsbabelfe, a QT based frontend for gpsbabel.
