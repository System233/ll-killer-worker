    correlates digital photos with GPS data filling EXIF fields (GUI)
    gpscorrelate fills EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) fields of
    digital photos related to GPS (Global Positioning System) information
    (e.g.: GPSLatitude, GPSLongitude, GPSAltitude, ...). The act of filling
    those fields is referred to as "correlation".

    Inputs of the correlation process are a set of JPEG images and GPS data
    encoded in GPX (GPS Exchange Format) format.

    If GPS data are available at the precise moment the photo was taken
    (with a 1-second granularity) the GPS data are stored unmodified in
    EXIF fields. If they are not linear interpolation of GPS data
    available at moments before and after the photo was taken can be used.

    Both a command line tool (package gpscorrelate) and a GTK+ graphical
    user interface for it (package gpscorrelate-gui) are provided.

    This package contains the GTK+ graphical user interface.
