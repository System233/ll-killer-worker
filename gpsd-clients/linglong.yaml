    Global Positioning System - clients
    The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
    a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
    sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.

    This package contains auxiliary tools and example clients for monitoring,
    testing, latency-profiling, device configuration and simulating gpsd.
