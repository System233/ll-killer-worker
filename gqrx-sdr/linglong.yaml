    Software defined radio receiver
    Gqrx works with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr, including Funcube
    Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR.

    Gqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an
    FFT-only instrument. The built-in Gqrx AFSK1200 decoder can decode
    and display AX.25 packets.  There are also various hooks for
    interacting with external applications using network sockets.

    Wideband FM mode has mono, stereo, and RDS (Radio Data System) modes.
    Displays FFT plot and spectrum waterfall.

    It is powered by GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit.
