    sample-based pipe organ simulator
    GrandOrgue allows the user to load and play virtual pipe organs.
    Using sample sets, GrandOrgue is able to combine the individual pipe
    sounds and organ behaviors to simulate a variety of pipe organs.

    When connected to MIDI keyboards and an audio system, it can accurately
    simulate the sound of a real pipe organ.

    The user can create and load organ samplesets using a dedicated file format. A
    demonstration organ sampleset is provided in the grandorgue-demo package.
