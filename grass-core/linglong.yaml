    GRASS GIS core components
    Commonly referred to as GRASS, this is a Geographic Information
    System (GIS) used for geospatial data management and analysis,
    image processing, graphics/map production, spatial modeling, and
    visualization. GRASS is currently used in academic and commercial
    settings around the world, as well as by many government agencies
    and environmental consulting companies.

    This package contains the core processing components, but not the GUI.
