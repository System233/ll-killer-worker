    clone of Gravity Force
    Gravity Wars is inspired by Gravity Force, one of the greatest games
    for the Amiga. This version is a little different, with a much higher
    resolution, and better graphics.

    The aim of the game is to guide a spaceship using only thrust and
    orientation to the exit, fighting against gravity and inertia. It
    includes some new features like water, exploding doors, bonus objects,
    fans (ie. wind), and some other special effects like exploding bullets
    and splashing water.

    Gravity Wars is no longer maintained upstream and this Debian package
    should be considered the current upstream version.
