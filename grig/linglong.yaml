    graphical user interface to the Ham Radio Control Libraries
    GNOME RIG is a graphical user interface to the Ham Radio Control Libraries,
    which lets you control your communication radios and/or antenna rotators from
    a personal computer. GNOME RIG is written using the Gtk+ and GNOME widgets.

    GNOME RIG is in a very early stage and it supports only a very little subset
    of the full Hamlib API, but it can be very useful in testing basic hamlib
    support for your rig.
