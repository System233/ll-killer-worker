    GTK+ based tool to make annotations on screen with multiple pointers
    Gromit-MPX enables you to make annotations on your screen using
    multiple pointing devices at once.

    This is especially useful when making presentations, to highlight
    things or point out things of interest.

    Gromit-MPX is XInput-Aware, so if you have a graphic tablet you can
    draw lines with different strength, color, erase things, etc.
