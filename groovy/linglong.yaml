    Agile dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine
    Groovy is an agile dynamic language for the JVM combining lots of great
    features from languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk and making them
    available to the Java developers using a Java-like syntax.

    Groovy is designed to help you get things done on the Java platform in a
    quicker, more concise and fun way - bringing the power of Python and Ruby
    inside the Java platform.

    Groovy can be used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate
    standard Java bytecode to be used by any Java project or it can be used
    dynamically as an alternative language such as for scripting Java objects,
    templating or writing unit test cases.
