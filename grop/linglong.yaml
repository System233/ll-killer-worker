    Graphic interface for the porg package manager/organizer
    Grop is the graphic interface of porg. It uses and depends on the GTKMM
    library. It's not meant to be a replacement of  porg, since it lacks some
    important features like logging package installations, but it allows for
    manipulating the installed packages in a more comfortable way.

    This package is a complete replacement for the deprecated 'gpaco' package.
