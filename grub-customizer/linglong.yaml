    GUI to configure GRUB2 and BURG
    Grub Customizer is a graphical interface to configure GRUB2 and BURG. It can
    do changes for settings and menuentries easily.

    Grub Customizer has the following features:
    * Move, remove or rename menuentries (they stey updatable by update-grub).
    * Edit the contents of menuentries or create new ones (internally it edits
    the 40_custom file).
    * Provide reinstallation of the bootloader to MBR.
    * Allow make settings like default operating system, kernel params,
    background image, text colors, etc.
    * Allow one to change the installed operating system by running on a live
    CD/DVD or from an OS inside a flash drive.

    Grub Customizer is useful for customizations and recovering actions over any
    Linux distribution.
