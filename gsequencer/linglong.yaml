    Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer audio processing engine
    Advanced GTK+ Sequencer is intended to be used for music composition.
    It features a piano roll, as well as a synth, matrix editor, drum
    machine, soundfont2 player, mixer and an output panel. Itâ€™s designed to
    be highly configurable. You may add effects to its effect chain; and
    add or remove audio channels/pads. You may set up a fully functional
    network of engines, thus there is a link editor for linking audio lines.
