    graphical user interface for smartctl
    GSmartControl is a graphical user interface for smartctl, which is a tool for
    querying and controlling SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting
    Technology) data on modern hard disk drives. It allows you to inspect the
    drive's SMART data to determine its health, as well as run various tests on it.

    Features:

    * automatically reports and highlights any anomalies;
    * allows enabling/disabling Automatic Offline Data Collection;
    * allows enabling/disabling SMART itself;
    * supports configuration of global and per-drive options for smartctl;
    * performs SMART self-tests;
    * displays drive IDs, capabilities, attributes, and self-test/error logs;
    * can read in smartctl data from a saved file, interpreting it as a read-only
    virtual device.
