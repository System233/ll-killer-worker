    Tangram (puzzle) game using GTK+
    The Tangram is a Chinese puzzle where the player has to arrange a set of
    pieces to match a given shape. All the pieces must be used and should not
    be laid on top of one another. The pieces are five triangles, a square and
    a parallelogram. gtans contains more than 380 figures to play with. It uses
    the mouse to control pieces. gtans is highly customizable using the
    interface.
