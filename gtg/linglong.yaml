    organizer for the GNOME desktop environment
    Getting Things GNOME! (GTG) is a personal tasks and TODO-list items
    organizer for the GNOME desktop environment and inspired by the
    "Getting Things Done" (GTD) methodology.

    GTG is designed with flexibility, adaptability, and ease of use in
    mind, so its user interface and workflow can be used as more than
    just "GTD" software. GTG is intended to help you track everything
    you need to do and need to know, from small tasks to large projects.

    It features flexible tagging system, natural language parsing, task
    dependencies and an "actionable" task view mode so that you can focus
    on what you can act on "right now".
