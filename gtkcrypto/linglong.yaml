    GTK+ application for encrypting files and computing hashes
    GTKCrypto allows you to encrypt and sign files or text. Moreover, given a file,
    different types of hash can be computed and files can also be compared to check
    whether or not their content is the same.
    Supported cipher algorithms: AES, Twofish, Serpent and Camellia, all using 256
    bits key and operating in either CBC or CTR mode.
    Supported hash algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, GOST, Whirlpool.
