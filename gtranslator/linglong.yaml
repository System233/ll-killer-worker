    PO-file editor for the GNOME Desktop
    GNOME Translation Editor is a po file editor which makes translating gettext
    applications as easy as possible, even for people with no translation
    experience.

    It supports the usage of translation memories, syntax highlighting, spell
    checking, undoing of insertions and deletions, and general integration with
    the GNOME Desktop.
