    Guake terminal app indicator
    Guake indicator lets you send custom commands through the D-Bus System.
    Commands can be manually edited in a XML file under ~/.guake.indicator
    or generated through guake-indicator edit-menu system GUI.

    Guake-indicator sticks to your "System Tray" and displays your
    favorites commands retrieved from ~/.guake.indicator/guake-indicator.xml.
    If guake-indicator.xml does not exist, guake-indicator will create a default
    configuration file with some examples.
command:
