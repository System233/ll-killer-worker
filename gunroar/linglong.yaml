    360-degree gunboat shooter
    Gunroar is an excellent shooter in which the game environment turns to be
    the sea and your spaceship an armed boat. The player moves around in a
    level generated randomly, and containing enemy islands, turrets and
    enemy boats) and that never ends. Each enemy killed increments your
    points according to the time it took you to destroy it and its size.

    Gunroar is another gem among many by Kenta Cho.
