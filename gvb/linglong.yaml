    visual simulator of 1 and 2-dimensional vibrations
    Good ViBrations (gvb) is a small program that aims at providing a nice
    interface to play with waves in 1 or 2 dimensions.

    It features several ways of setting initial conditions, as well as different
    calculation methods and graphic outputs. It is also possible to dump animation
    frames to png images in order to make a movie with them.

    It relies on the Python library scipy to get the best possible performance in
    calculations.
