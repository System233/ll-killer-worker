    Running gvidm will pop up a list of available modes and allows the user
    to select one if desired. This makes it perfect for running from an
    application menu or a hotkey, so you don't have to use ram for an applet
    constantly running. If you are running dual or multi-head displays, it
    will give you a list of screens so you can select the appropriate one.
