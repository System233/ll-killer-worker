    GNUstep Workspace Manager
    GWorkspace is the official GNUstep workspace manager. It is a clone
    of NeXT's workspace manager. GWorkspace is probably one of the most
    useful and usable workspace managers available on any platform,
    owing to its well-designed interface and the natural, consistent
    design that it inherits from the GNUstep framework.
