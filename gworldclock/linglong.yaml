    Displays time and date in specified time zones
    This program displays the time and date of specified time zones using a
    GTK+ interface. It also provides a "rendezvous" function allowing the zones
    to be synchronised to a time other than the current time. This can help you
    organise meetings across different timezones.

    The time zones may be entered by hand in TZ format or chosen from a list
    prepared from /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  The zone list is kept in a format
    consistent with the shell script tzwatch.
