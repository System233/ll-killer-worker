    Scanning Probe Microscopy visualization and analysis tool
    Gwyddion is a modular program for Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) data
    visualization and analysis. It is primarily intended for analysis of height
    field data obtained by microscopy techniques like
    * Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),
    * Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM),
    * Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM),
    * Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (SNOM or NSOM)
    and others. However, it can be used for arbitrary height field and
    image analysis.

    This package contains the main application and its modules. It also contains
    a GNOME (and Xfce) thumbnailer which creates previews for all file types known
    to Gwyddion.
