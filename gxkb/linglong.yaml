    X11 keyboard indicator and switcher
    gxkb is a little indicator applet which allows one to quickly
    switch between different keyboard layouts in X. A flag
    corresponding to the country of the active layout is shown
    in the indicator area.

    The applet is written in C and uses the GTK+ library and
    therefore does not depend on any GNOME components.
