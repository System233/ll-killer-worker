    time tracking application for GNOME
    Project Hamster helps you to keep track of how much time you spend on various
    activities during the day.  Whenever you move from one task to another, you
    can change your current activity, or you can record time spent afterwards.

    It can present graphical statistics of how long you have spent on each task,
    and may be useful for project management or keeping employee timesheets.

    This package contains the background daemon and GNOME application, an
    extension to integrate into the gnome-shell top bar is separately available.
