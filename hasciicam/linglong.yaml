    (h)ascii for the masses: live video as text
    Hasciicam makes it possible to have live ASCII video on the web. It
    captures video from a tv card and renders it into ascii, formatting the
    output into an html page with a refresh tag or in a live ASCII window or
    in a simple text file as well, giving the possibility to anybody that has a
    bttv card, a Linux box and a cheap modem line to show a live ASCII video
    feed that can be browsable without any need for plugin, java etc.
