    Emulator for the Atari ST, STE, TT, and Falcon computers
    Hatari is an emulator for the Atari ST line of computers.

    The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by
    Atari in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer
    having quite a lot of CPU power at that time.

    Unlike most other open source Atari ST emulators which try to provide a good
    environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware
    of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old Atari
    games and demos. Because of this, it may be somewhat slower than less accurate
    emulators.
