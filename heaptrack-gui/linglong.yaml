    heap memory profiler for Linux
    Heap memory usage profiler. It uses LD_PRELOAD to track all calls
    to the core memory allocation functions and logs these occurrences.
    Additionally, backtraces are obtained and logged. It can also
    generate a historigram of allocation sizes over the number of
    calls. Heaptrack measures the following:

    * Heap memory consumption (like Massif).
    * Number of calls to allocation functions (like callgrind).
    * Total amount of memory allocated, ignoring deallocations.
    * Leaked memory (like memcheck).

    Heaptrack is notable for its ability to attach to running processes,
    for consuming substantially less memory than Valgrind, and for not
    reducing an application's interactivity as much as Valgrind does.
    Heaptrack is useful for debugging memory leaks and memory ballooning.

    The package contains the GUI for data analysis.
