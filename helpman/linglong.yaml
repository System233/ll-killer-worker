    quick & easy access to 4000+ manuals / guides / tutorials
    Helpman provides a classified access to the manuals, installed by user/system
    programs, automatically. It also supports typing a program / manual name, in
    the Select Manual: text / combo box directly, to display it quickly. Error
    Messages will be shown below, if a manual is not found.

    The Manual Type list box, shows sections 1 to 8, useful for specific display
    of  a version of the manual. Say for example, if you see, CRON(8) in a manual,
    it means the CRON manual in the 8th section. So users should choose
    appropriately.
