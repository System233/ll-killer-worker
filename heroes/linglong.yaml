    Collect powerups and avoid your opponents' trails
    Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but includes
    many graphical improvements and new game features.  In it, you must maneuver
    a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding obstacles,
    your opponents' trails, and even your own trail.

    Several styles of play are available, including "get-all-the-bonuses",
    deathmatch, and "squish-the-pedestrians".  All game styles can be played
    in both single-player and two-player (split-screen) modes.

    You should install the heroes-sound-effects package if you want sound effects,
    and the heroes-sound-tracks package if you want background music in the game.
