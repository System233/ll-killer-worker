    Color matching puzzle
    Hexalate is a color matching game. The goal of the game is to rotate and
    position the circles so that each touching line matches in color. You rotate
    circles by right clicking, and you move circles by dragging them. The game
    stores the positions and rotations of the circles across runs.
