    Yamaha DX7 modeling DSSI plugin
    hexter is a software synthesizer that models the sound generation of a Yamaha
    DX7 synthesizer. It can easily load most DX7 patch bank files, accept patch
    editing commands via MIDI sys-ex messages, and recreate the sound of the DX7
    with great accuracy.
