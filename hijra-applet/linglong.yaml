    Hijri Tray Applet for GNOME (also works with KDE) that uses Hijra Algorithm by
    Muayyad Saleh Alsadi provided by python-hijra package.

    This algorithm is based on integer operations which that there is no round
    errors (given accurate coefficients) the accuracy of this algorithm is based
    on 3 constants (p, q and a) where p/q is the full months percentage [ gcd(p,q)
    must be 1 ] currently it is set to 191/360 which mean that there is 191 months
    having 30 days in a span of 360 years, other months are 29 days, and a is just
    a shift.
