    interactive graphical processing and analysis of EXAFS data
    ATHENA is an interactive graphical utility for processing EXAFS data. It
    handles most of the common data handling chores of interest, including
    deglitching, aligning, merging, background removal, and Fourier transforms.

    ARTEMIS is an interactive graphical utility for fitting EXAFS data using
    theoretical standards from FEFF and sophisticated data modelling along with
    flexible data visualization and statistical analysis.

    HEPHAESTUS is a souped up periodic table for the x-ray absorption
    spectroscopist. It provides a number of utilities involving tables of
    absorption coefficients and other chemical data.
