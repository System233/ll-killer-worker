    JACK capable organ softsynth
    Horgand is a JACK capable organ client with presets and some effects
    incorporated. It generates the sound in real time like a FM
    synthesizer. Due this, you can change the frequency of all the drawars
    and add some special effects. It features auto-accompaniment, looped
    drums, and a bass line in a wave table way.
