    EDA layout and schematic application
    Horizon is an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool for circuit
    board design. It manages the full design flow from schematic entry
    to gerber export. The main differentiator from KiCAD is a different
    (more sane) part library design. It is quite new software in 2018
    so may have rough edges but is already very capable.

    Notable features:
    * Sane library management
    * Unified editor for everything from symbol to board
    * Netlist-aware schematic editor
    * KiCad's awesome interactive router
    * Lag- and glitch-free rendering
    * Rule-based DRC
    * Undo/redo
    * Copy/paste for some objects
    * Builds and runs on Linux and Windows
