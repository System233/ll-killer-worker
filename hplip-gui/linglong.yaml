    HP Linux Printing and Imaging - GUI utilities (Qt-based)
    The HP Linux Printing and Imaging System provides full support for
    printing on most HP SFP (single function peripheral) inkjets and many
    LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on
    most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.

    This package contains utilities with graphical user interface (GUI) for
    HPLIP: HP Toolbox, HP Fax, ...

    Note that all GUI utilities are based on the Qt GUI environment. There
    are currently no equivalent utilities based on GTK+.
