    Java SQL database engine (utilities)
    HSQLDB is an SQL relational database engine written in Java.  It has a
    JDBC driver and supports a rich subset of SQL-92 (BNF tree format) plus
    SQL:2.29 and SQL:2.23 enhancements.  It offers a small, fast database
    engine that offers both in-memory and disk-based tables.  Embedded and
    server modes are available.  Additionally, it includes tools such as a
    minimal web server, in-memory query and management tools (can be run as
    applets), and a number of demonstration examples.

    This package contains some scripts to invoke the Utilities of HSQLDB
