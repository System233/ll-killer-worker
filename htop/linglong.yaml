    interactive processes viewer
    Htop is an ncursed-based process viewer similar to top, but it
    allows one to scroll the list vertically and horizontally to see
    all processes and their full command lines.

    Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
    entering their PIDs.
