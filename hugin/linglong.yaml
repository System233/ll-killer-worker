    panorama photo stitcher - GUI tools
    Hugin is a panorama photo stitching program. Essentially, Hugin is a
    GUI frontend for Panorama Tools. Stitching is accomplished by using
    several overlapping photos taken from the same location, and using
    control points to align and transform the photos so that they can be
    blended together to form a larger image. Hugin allows for the easy
    creation of control points between two images, optimization of the
    image transforms, and much more.

    This package includes the following graphical interfaces, using the
    command-line tools provided in the hugin-tools package:
    * hugin                - Hugin panorama creator.
    * hugin_stitch_project - Hugin batch stitcher.
    * PTBatcherGUI         - Batch controller for the stitching process.
    * calibrate_lens_gui   - Lens calibration tool.
