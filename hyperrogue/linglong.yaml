    non-euclidean graphical rogue-like game
    HyperRogue is a game in which the player collects treasures and fights
    monsters -- rogue-like but for the fact that it is played on the hyperbolic
    plane and not in euclidean space.

    In HyperRogue, the player can move through different parts of the world, which
    are home to particular creatures and may be subject to own rules of "physics".

    While it can use ASCII characters to display the world the classical rogue
    symbols, the game needs graphics to render the non-euclidean world.
