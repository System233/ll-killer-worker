    improved dynamic tiling window manager
    Key features of i3 are good documentation, reasonable defaults (changeable in
    a simple configuration file) and good multi-monitor support. The user
    interface is designed for power users and emphasizes keyboard usage. i3 uses
    XCB for asynchronous communication with X11 and aims to be fast and
    light-weight.

    Please be aware i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.
