    Iagno is a computer version of the game Reversi, more popularly called
    Othello. Iagno is a two player strategy game similar to Go. The board
    is 8 by 8 with tiles that are black on one side and white on the other
    side. The object of Iagno is to flip as many of your opponent's tiles
    to your color as possible without your opponent flipping your tiles.
    This is done by trapping your opponent's tiles between two tiles of
    your own color.
