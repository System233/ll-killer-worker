    graphical OSC sequencer for digital arts
    IanniX is a graphical sequencer for digital arts,
    inspired by Iannis Xenakis' upic system for graphical scores.
    IanniX manages events described via graphical elements (like curves) and
    controls your real-time environment via Open Sound Control (OSC).
    It can also be fully controlled via OSC (or FUDI, if you prefer).
