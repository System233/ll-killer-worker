    Implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP)
    NetX provides a drop-in replacement for javaws (Java Web Start). Since
    upstream NetX is dead, the IcedTea Web project is hosting a fork of the
    original code. However, as icedtea-web has evolved to complex set of tools,
    extensions and tests, it has now only a few lines of code shared with the
    original implementation.

    IcedTea's NetX currently supports verification of signed jars, trusted
    certificate storing, system certificate store checking, and provides
    the services specified by the JNLP API.
