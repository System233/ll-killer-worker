    IDE for Python using Tkinter (default version)
    IDLE is an Integrated Development Environment for Python.
    IDLE is written using Tkinter and therefore quite platform-independent.

    This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
    Python 3 version's IDLE (currently v3.12).
