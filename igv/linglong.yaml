    Integrative Genomics Viewer
    The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that
    efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a
    smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution.
    A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of
    genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation
    sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data.
    Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources,
    its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and
    explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV
    supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is
    optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration
    on standard desktop systems.
