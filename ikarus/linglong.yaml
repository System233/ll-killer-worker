    Scheme compiler and interpreter
    Ikarus is a compiler-based implementation of the Scheme programming
    language which targets the i386/amd64 (with sse2) architecture.  It
    has good performance, is rather light weight, is case-sensitive, and
    implements a substantial portion of the language described in R6RS.
