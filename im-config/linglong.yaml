    Input method configuration framework
    im-config package provides the framework to configure and to switch
    the input method. This input method is the essential mechanism for
    Japanese, Chinese and Korean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII
    native characters.

    Many modern input methods such as IBus support not only one of these CJK
    languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by
    dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI helper program.

    By installing this package, the most desirable input method and its
    backend conversion engine are automatically configured with both the X
    Window System Input Method (XIM), GTK input method module, Qt input
    method module, and clutter input method module.

    You can further customize your input method with 'im-config' command.
