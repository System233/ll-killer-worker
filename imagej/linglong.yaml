  description: |-
    Image processing program with a focus on microscopy images
    It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit and
    32-bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG,
    BMP, DICOM, FITS and "raw". It supports "stacks", a series of images that
    share a single window.

    It can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined
    selections. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density
    histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing
    functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge
    detection and median filtering.

    Spatial calibration is available to provide real world dimensional
    measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or gray scale
    calibration is also available.

    ImageJ is developed by Wayne Rasband (wayne@codon.nih.gov), is at the
    Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda,
    Maryland, USA.
