    image manipulation programs -- quantum depth Q16HDRI
    ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
    It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100)
    including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript,
    SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
    shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special
    effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.
    All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through
    an X11 graphical interface (display).

    For working with the SVG, WMF, OpenEXR, DjVu and Graphviz formats,
    you need to install the libmagickcore-6.q16hdri-7-extra package.

    This version of imagemagick is compiled for a channel
    depth of 16 bits with high dynamic range (Q16HDRI).
