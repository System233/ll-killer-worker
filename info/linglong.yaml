    Standalone GNU Info documentation browser
    The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online
    documents. This program allows you to view Info documents, like the
    ones stored in /usr/share/info.

    Much of the software in Debian comes with its online documentation in
    the form of Info files, so it is most likely you will want to install it.
