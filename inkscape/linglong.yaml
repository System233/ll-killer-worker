    vector-based drawing program
    Inkscape is an illustration editor which has everything needed to
    create professional-quality computer art. You can use it to make
    diagrams and illustrations, technical drawings, web graphics, clip art,
    icons and logos. A collection of hands-on tutorials show you how to
    combine lines, shapes and text of different types and styles to build
    up a picture.

    A selection of powerful vector graphics editing tools comes as
    standard. There is excellent support for paths, gradients, layers,
    alpha transparency and text flow control. An extensive library of
    filters allow you to apply realistic effects and extensions allow you
    to work with bitmaps, barcodes and printing marks, amongst other things.

    Most of the common vector formats are supported, including PDF, Adobe
    Illustrator and AutoCAD files, and it has unrivalled support for the
    SVG web graphics standard.
