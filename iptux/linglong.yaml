    Intranet communication tool for Linux
    iptux is an “IP Messenger” client for Linux.

    It can:
    - auto-detect other clients on the intranet.
    - send message to other clients.
    - send file to other clients.

    It is (supposedly) compatible with 飞鸽传书 (Feige) and 飞秋 (FeiQ)
    from China, and with the original “IP Messenger” clients from Japan
    as listed on http://ipmsg.org/ including g2ipmsg and xipmsg in Debian.
