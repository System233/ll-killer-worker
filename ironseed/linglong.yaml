    It was originally both developed and published by Channel 7 for DOS in 1994.
    Gameplay is real-time, featuring trading, diplomacy, and strategy, and
    somewhat resembles Star Control 2 / Ur-Quan masters.

    Storyline: Escaping the iron fist of a fanatic theocracy, the members of
    the Ironseed Movement launch into space and are set adrift after suffering
    a computer malfunction. As captain, you awaken along with the crew some
    thousand years later and are confronted by an alien horde...
