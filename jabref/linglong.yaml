    graphical frontend to manage BibTeX and BibLaTeX databases
    JabRef is a graphical Java application for editing BibTeX (.bib) databases.
    JabRef lets you organize your entries into overlapping logical groups, and
    with a single click limit your view to a single group or an intersection or
    union of several groups. You can customize the entry information shown in the
    main window, and sort by any of the standard BibTeX fields. JabRef can
    autogenerate BibTeX keys for your entries. JabRef also lets you easily link
    to PDF or web sources for your reference entries.

    JabRef can import from and export to several formats, and you can customize
    export filters. JabRef can be run as a command line application to convert
    from any import format to any export format.
