    Virtual MIDI keyboard for JACK MIDI
    JACK keyboard is a program that allows you to send JACK MIDI
    events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard. It's somewhat similar to
    vkeybd, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the default
    keyboard mapping is much better - it uses the same layout as
    trackers (like Impulse Tracker) did, so you have two and half
    octaves under your fingers.
