    high-quality system for audio network performances (GUI)
    JackTrip is a Linux and Mac OS X-based system used for multi-machine
    network performance over the Internet. It supports any number of
    channels (as many as the computer/network can handle) of bidirectional,
    high quality, uncompressed audio signal streaming.

    You can use it between any combination of Linux and Mac OS X systems
    (i.e., one end using Linux can connect to the other using Mac OS X).

    It is currently being developed and actively tested at CCRMA by the
    SoundWIRE group.

    This package contains the GUI version of jacktrip, which also includes
    RtAudio support.
