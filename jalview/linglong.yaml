    multiple alignment editor
    JalView is a Java DNA, RNA and protein sequence alignment editor that can work
    with sequence alignments produced by programs implementing alignment
    algorithms such as clustalw, kalign and t-coffee.

    It has lots of features, is actively developed, and will compare
    advantageously to BioEdit, while being free as in free speech!
