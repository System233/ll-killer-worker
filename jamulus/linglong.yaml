    real-time collaborative music session client and server
    Jamulus, a low-latency audio client and server, enables musicians to
    perform real-time “jam” sessions over the internet. It is available
    across multiple platforms, so participants of any field can communicate
    without specialist setup requirements. This is not restricted to music,
    of course; other use (perhaps conferencing?) is also possible.

    One participant starts Jamulus in server mode, ideally on a dedicated
    server (virtual) machine; all participants start the (graphical) client
    which transmits audio to the server, receiving back a mixed stream. Use
    of a metronome is recommended.
