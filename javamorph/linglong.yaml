    Java morphing film-make program for pixel picture-input
    Give two human-face pictures as inputs into the program. Then mark
    important locations whithin both faces by pairs of corresponding points.
    The program will create a short enumerated picture series in which the left
    face moves (morphs) into the right one. You can then create a MPEG (see
    mencoder) from the picture series. An animated GIF (see GIMP) is also
    possible.
