    Tool for the development & use of multimedia educational activities
    JClic is formed by a set of computer applications that are used for
    carrying out different types of educational activities: puzzles,
    associations, text exercises, crosswords...

    The activities are not usually used alone, but packed in projects. A
    project is formed by a set of activities and one or more sequences,
    which indicate the order in which they have to be shown.

    Its community (http://clic.xtec.net/db/listact_en.jsp) has developed a web
    site with more than 1.000 activities available in several languages.

    This package contains JClic-author to create and modify activity
    projects, JClic standalone player to play the activities and
    JClic-reports that allows the management of a database to track
    students work and results.
