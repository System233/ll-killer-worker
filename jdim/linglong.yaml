    simple browser for "2ch-style" web forum sites
    JDim (JD improved) offers a comfortable browsing experience on 2ch-style
    bulletin board systems. Its features include:

    - automated login,
    - message viewing/posting,
    - image viewing,
    - mouse gestures,
    - ignore lists,
    - "play-by-play" mode.

    It can also significantly reduce the load on servers by bypassing CGI programs
    and directly retrieving thread data files to your local hard drives.

    "2ch-style" web forum sites have their origins in 2channel, which was a very
    popular Internet forum in Japan. Such sites are often available only in the
    Japanese language.
