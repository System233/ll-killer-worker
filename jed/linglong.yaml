    Jed is a small, fast and powerful text editor, yet starts faster than
    bash.

    Completely customizable with prepared emulation modes for Emacs, CUA
    (similar to KDE/Gnome/OpenOffice), Borland-IDE, Brief, and EDT. Extensible
    in the S-Lang scripting language (with a syntax resembling C).

    Editing functions: folding support, rectangular cut/paste, regular
    expression search/replace, incremental searches, search/replace across
    multiple files, multiple windows, multiple buffers, ...

    Tools: directory editor (dired), info (browse GNU info files), mail,
    rmail, ispell, shell mode, ...

    Special modes (syntax highlight, indention, compile, ...) for
    Basic, C, C++, DCL, FORTRAN, IDL, Java, nroff, Pascal, Perl, PHP,
    PostScript, Python, sh.  Modes for markup languages include HTML and
    (La)TeX (with AUC-TeX style editing and BibTeX)
