    graphical user interface to EMBOSS
    EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
    the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
    automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
    transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
    libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
    scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
    also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
    analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
    commercial software packages.

    Jemboss is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to EMBOSS, the European Molecular
    Biology Open Software Suite. It is part of the EMBOSS distribution.
