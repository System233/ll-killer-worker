    board game similar to Othello
    Simple two-player turn-based strategy game played on an 8x8 grid.
    Convert the opponent's pieces to your color by bracketing them between
    your pieces.  The game can be played head-to-head on a single screen or
    by a single player against the computer. Jester allows you to waste
    valuable time that could otherwise be spent playing Solitaire.
