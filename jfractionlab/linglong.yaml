    Educative program to practice fractions
    JFractionLab is a nice tool for math students that are learning the use
    and operation of fractions.

    It provides a collection of nice exercices with a numeric and visual
    representation of the fractions.

    JFractionLab shows the user every step of the calculation and therefore
    helps him to understand them.

    It gives the user an answer after each input, making impossible to have
    a false answer.
