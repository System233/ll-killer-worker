    JFtp is a graphical Java network and file transfer client. It
    supports FTP using its own FTP API and various other protocols like
    SMB, SFTP, NFS, HTTP, and file I/O using third party APIs. It
    includes many advanced features such as recursive directory
    up/download, browsing FTP servers while transferring files, FTP
    resuming and queueing, browsing the LAN for Windows shares, and
    more. Multiple connections can open at a time in a Mozilla-style
    tabbed browsing environment.
