    horizontal or vertical bargraph audio level meter for Jack Audio Connection Kit
    A jkmeter displays both the true RMS level and the
    digital peak level.
    But can display stereo correlation too.

    Jkmeter is based on the ideas of mastering guru Bob Katz.
    See <https://www.digido.com/bob-katz/index.php> and
    follow the links on 'level practices'.
    This is the type of meter you want for live recording,
    mixing and mastering
