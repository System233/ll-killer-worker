    audio test signals meter
    A jnoisemeter is a small app designed to measure audio
    test signals and in particular noise signals.

    The simplest use is to measure the S/N ratio of your
    sound card. If you can calibrate the input levels of
    your soundcard it can also be used (with some external
    hardware) to measure noise levels of any type of audio
    equipment, including preamps and microphones.
