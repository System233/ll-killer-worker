  description: |-
    reimplement the joe Debian package using jupp
    This package contains symbolic links to replace the Debian joe package
    using the jupp package’s JOE implementation (binaries and manpages).
    It also contains the appropriate conffiles and, in contrast to Debian’s
    joe flavour, supports SELinux context copying (on Debian systems with
    the Linux kernel), and has many bugs fixed and makes some of jupp’s new
    features available to the joe, jstar, jmacs, jpico and rjoe flavours.
