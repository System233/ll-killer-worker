    Editor for OpenStreetMap
    JOSM is an editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM) written in Java.
    The current version supports stand alone GPX tracks, GPX track data
    from OSM database and existing nodes, line segments and metadata tags
    from the OSM database.

    OpenStreetMap is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing
    free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them.
    The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually
    have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people
    from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.
