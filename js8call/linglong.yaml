    Amateur Radio Digital Mode providing weak signal messaging
    JS8Call is using the JS8 Digital Mode for providing weak signal keyboard to
    keyboard messaging to Amateur Radio Operators.

    JS8Call is an experiment to test the feasibility of a digital mode with the
    robustness of FT8, combined with a messaging and network protocol layer for
    weak signal communication on HF, using a keyboard messaging style interface.
    It is not designed for any specific purpose other than connecting amateur
    radio operators who are operating under weak signal conditions. JS8Call is
    heavily inspired by WSJT-X, Fldigi, and FSQCall and would not exist without
    the hard work and dedication of the many developers in the amateur radio
    community.
