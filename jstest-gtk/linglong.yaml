    joystick testing and configuration tool
    jstest-gtk is a simple graphical joystick tester. It provides a list
    of attached joysticks, and for each one can display which buttons and
    axes are pressed, remap axes and buttons, and calibrate the device.

    Even when your joystick is working mostly fine, you might want to
    give it a try, as the calibration lets you get rid of overlarge
    default deadzones that many joysticks use and which are a noticeable
    problem in some games.

    Installing the joystick package in addition to this one will allow
    you to store your calibration settings and mappings and have the
    automatically restored.
