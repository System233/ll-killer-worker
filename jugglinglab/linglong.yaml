    Application for creating and animating juggling patterns
    Juggling Lab is an application written in Java for creating and animating
    juggling patterns.

    Its main goals are to help people learn juggling patterns, and to assist in
    inventing new ones.

    It generates and animates synchronous and asynchronous siteswaps and also
    multiplex siteswaps. Hand and body movement can be adjusted.

    Part of the program is its siteswap generator, which allows one to generate
    siteswaps automatically by entering parameters like the number of objects,
    maximum height of throws and length of the pattern.
