    Jupyter - Qt console (binaries)
    IPython can be used as a replacement for the standard Python shell,
    or it can be used as a complete working environment for scientific
    computing (like Matlab or Mathematica) when paired with the standard
    Python scientific and numerical tools. It supports dynamic object
    introspections, numbered input/output prompts, a macro system,
    session logging, session restoring, complete system shell access,
    verbose and colored traceback reports, auto-parentheses,
    auto-quoting, and is embeddable in other Python programs.

    This package contains the qtconsole binaries for the Python 3
    interpreter.
