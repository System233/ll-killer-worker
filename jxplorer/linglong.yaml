    Java LDAP Browser
    JXplorer is an open source LDAP browser originally developed by
    Computer Associates' eTrust Directory development lab. It is a
    standards compliant general purpose LDAP browser that can be used
    to read and search any LDAP directory, or any X500 directory with
    an LDAP interface.
    JXplorer is a fully functional piece of software with advanced
    security integration and support for the more difficult and
    obscure parts of the LDAP protocol. It should run on any Java
    supporting operating system.

    * Standard LDAP operations: add/delete/copy/modify
    * Complex operations: tree copy and tree delete
    * Optional GUI based search filter construction

    * pluggable security providers
    * HTML templates/forms for data display
    * Full i18n support
    * LDIF file format support
    * highly user configurable
