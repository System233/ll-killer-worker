    graphical disk usage display with cleanup facilities
    K4DirStat (KDE Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that sums
    up disk usage for directory trees, very much like the Unix 'du' command.
    It displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both numerically
    and graphically.  It is network transparent (i.e., you can use it to sum
    up FTP servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable cleanup
    actions.  You can directly open a directory branch in Konqueror or the
    shell of your choice, compress it to a .tar.bz2 archive, or define your
    own cleanup actions.
