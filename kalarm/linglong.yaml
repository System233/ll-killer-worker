    alarm message, command and email scheduler
    KAlarm provides a graphical interface to schedule personal timed events -
    pop-up alarm messages, command execution and sending emails. There is a
    range of options for configuring recurring events.

    A pop-up alarm can show either a simple text message, or the contents of a
    text or image file. It can optionally be spoken, or play a sound file. You
    can choose its appearance, and set reminders. Among KAlarm's other
    facilities, you can set up templates to allow KAlarm to be used as a 'tea
    timer'.
