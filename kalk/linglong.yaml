    Powerful cross-platform calculator based on the Kirigami framework
    Kalk is a convergent calculator application built with the Kirigami framework.
    Although it is mainly targeted for mobile platforms, it can also be used
    on the desktop.

    Originally starting as a fork of Liri calculator, Kalk has gone through heavy
    development, and no longer shares the same codebase with Liri calculator.
