    beginner's drill game to learn Japanese kana characters
    Kanatest is a simple hiragana and katakana drill game. It checks your
    knowledge of Japanese kana characters.

    There are three drill modes: hiragana mode (hiragana charset only), katakana
    mode (katakana charset only) and mixed mode (both charsets). The tester shows
    random kana characters and waits until you enter the romaji equivalent in an
    entry field. At the end, statistics are provided.
