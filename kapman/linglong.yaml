    Pac-Man clone
    Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man. You must go through the
    levels escaping ghosts in a maze. You lose a life when a ghost eats you, but
    you can eat the ghosts for a few seconds when eating an energizer. You win
    points when eating pills, energizers, and bonus, and you win one life for
    each 10,000 points.  When you have eaten all the pills and energizers of a
    level, you go to the next level, and the player and ghost speeds increase.

    This package is part of the KDE games module.
