    Easy to use backup program
    Kbackup is a program that lets you back up any directories or files. It uses
    an easy to use directory tree to select the things to back up and lets you
    save your settings in "profile" files. These are simple textfiles containing
    definitions for directories and files to be included or excluded from the
    backup process.
