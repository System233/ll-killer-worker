    game of skill and reflexes for all the family
    A game of skill and reflexes, non violent, suitable for all ages. The idea
    is to move the ball around the map, without falling, without running out of
    time, and getting the prizes, in order to reach the exit. The main feature
    of the game is the built-in map editor, so anybody can make their own maps.
