    visualisation tool for the Valgrind profiler
    KCachegrind is a visualisation tool for the profiling data generated
    by calltree, a memory profiling tool for valgrind.  Any executable can be
    profiled using calltree without being recompiled, including multi-threaded
    applications, shared libraries, and plugins.

    For visualising the output from profiling tools other than Valgrind, several
    converters can be found in the kcachegrind-converters package.

    This package is part of the KDE Software Development Kit module.
