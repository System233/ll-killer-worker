    KC 85/4 emulator
    KCemu is an emulator for the KC85 homecomputer series and other
    Z80 based microcomputers like Z1013, LC80, Polycomputer 880 and
    BIC A5105. The emulation supports a number of additional hardware,
    e.g. floppy disk drives and extended graphic modules.

    The Debian package does not contain the ROM images required to
    run the emulated machines. Please refer to the README.Debian
    file for more information.

    Some alternate keywords for the above:
    KC85, KC87, LC80, Z1013, A5105, Polycomputer 880

    For original programs and general information about the
    emulated computer systems have a look at http://www.kc-club.de/
