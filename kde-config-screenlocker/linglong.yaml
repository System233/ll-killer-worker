    KCM Module for kscreenlocker
    KDE systemsettings module to configure kscreenlocker.

    kscreenlocker can be configured to support the PAM ("Pluggable Authentication
    Modules") system for password checking (for unlocking the display).

    PAM is a flexible application-transparent configurable user-authentication
    system found on FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux (and maybe other unixes).

    Information about PAM may be found on its homepage
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/
    (Despite the location, this information is NOT Linux-specific.)

    This package contains the KCM settings module for kscreenlocker.
