    implements a KDE configuration GUI for the Wacom drivers
    KDE Wacom tablet KCModule

    This module implements a GUI for the Wacom Linux Drivers and extends it
    with profile support to handle different button / pen layouts per profile.

    For hardware support have a look at http://www.linuxwacom.sourceforge.net

    All tablets can be set up as long as they are found via xorg.conf or HAL
    configuration.
