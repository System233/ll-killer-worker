    Telepathy text chat UI for the KDE Plasma Desktop
    This package provides a telepathy handler for text channels, a program
    that in other words allows you to chat with your contacts using instant
    text messages.

    In addition, this package also provides a UI for viewing telepathy
    text chat logs.

    This package is not meant to be used standalone. It is recommended
    to install the kde-telepathy metapackage instead.
