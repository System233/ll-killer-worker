    compares and merges 2 or 3 files or directories
    KDiff3 compares two or three input files and shows the differences
    line by line and character by character. It provides an automatic
    merge facility and an integrated editor for comfortable solving of
    merge conflicts. KDiff3 allows recursive directory comparison and
    merging as well. KDiff3 also has KIO support, so it can access to
    remote files and compressed archives.
