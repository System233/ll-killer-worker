    kanji drill and dictionary program
    This package provides a graphical program for learning Japanese
    characters, which also doubles as a dictionary lookup program.
    It requires a dictionary package, such as kanjidic (for learning
    kanji) or kanadic (for learning hiragana or katakana), although
    you can specify a custom dictionary file on the command line.

- /opt/apps/kdrill.linyaps/files/entrypoint.sh
