    bookmarks editor utility for KDE
    The editor shows a tree view of your KDE bookmarks and bookmark subfolders.

    Several applications in the KDE suite let you create bookmarks (e.g.
    Konqueror, Konsole, Konversation) and will launch this bookmark editor from
    their Bookmarks -> Edit Bookmarks menu item.
