    Ketm is a hicolor/hiresolution classical game that has similarities with
    Raptor, Tyrian and Galaga. You are a spacepilot controlling your secret
    prototype ship. At regular interval's you get attacked by the bad guys. You
    have a mission to clean this sector from them (i.e. Kill Everything That
    Moves). Be sure to pick up some weapon and ship upgrades on the way.
