    visual database applications builder
    KEXI is a visual database applications builder. It can be used for
    designing database applications, inserting and editing data,
    performing queries, and processing data. Forms can be created to
    provide a custom interface to your data. All database objects -
    tables, queries, forms, reports - are stored in the database, making
    it easy to share data and design.

    KEXI is considered as a long awaited Open Source competitor for MS Access,
    Filemaker and Oracle Forms. Its development is motivated by the lack of
    Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools for database systems that are
    sufficiently powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable
    across many operating systems and hardware platforms.
