    Type in your language with Keyman for Linux
    Keyman makes it possible for you to type in over 2,000 languages on Windows,
    macOS, Linux, iPhone, iPad, Android tablets and phones, and even instantly
    in your web browser. With the world's most powerful keyboarding engine,
    intuitive and rapid text input is now possible in your language, and for
    over 99% of the global population's mother tongues!

    Originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows, Keyman is now a free and
    open source keyboarding platform which allows anyone to write a keyboard
    layout for their language. Keyman is available for many platforms, including
    Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux and the web.

    Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard
    grammar. Keyman's contextual input model means keyboard layouts can be
    intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages.
    Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop
    and mobile platforms.
