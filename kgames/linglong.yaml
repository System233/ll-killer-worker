    Venerable selection of Xaw-based games
    These are a selection of various games that use the Xaw toolkit. They
    are all from the 80's and 90's and look the part. As a result, they
    are also very lightweight. There are a bunch of solitaire (patience)
    variants, mille bournes, cribbage and dominos.
