    Photo geotagging program
    Images can be associated with geographic coordinates (geotagging) by different
    means: On the one hand, a matching with GPX encoded geodata can be done, on
    the other hand, the coordinates can be set manually, either via drag and drop
    onto a map, via bookmarks or by manually supplying them.

    The coordinates can be stored in the images' Exif header and/or in XMP sidecar
    files.
