    Hangman word puzzle
    KHangMan is the well-known Hangman game, aimed towards children aged 6 and
    above.

    It picks a random word which the player must reveal by guessing if it contains
    certain letters.  As the player guesses letters, the word is gradually
    revealed, but 10 wrong guesses will end the game.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
