    KHelpCenter uses meta data files which describe the documentation
    available in the system. Each document is represented by a meta data
    file and shown as an entry in the KHelpCenter navigation tree view.
    The meta data contains information about title and short description
    of the document, the location of the document and some more
    information like how to search the document and translations of title
    and description. Document hierarchy is represented as hierarchy of
    the meta data files. Directories are also described by a meta data
    file which contains the same information as a document meta data
    file.
