    Electronic schematic and PCB design software
    Kicad is a suite of programs for the creation of printed circuit boards.
    It includes a schematic editor, a PCB layout tool, support tools and a
    3D viewer to display a finished & fully populated PCB.

    Kicad is made up of 5 main components:

    * kicad - project manager
    * eeschema - schematic editor
    * pcbnew - PCB editor
    * gerbview - GERBER viewer
    * cvpcb - footprint selector for components

    Libraries:
    * Both eeschema and pcbnew have library managers and editors for their
    components and footprints
    * You can easily create, edit, delete and exchange library items
    * Documentation files can be associated with components, footprints and key
    words, allowing a fast search by function
    * Very large libraries are available for schematic components and footprints
    * Most components have corresponding 3D models
