    port of the classic BSD console game robots
    killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. The robots are numerous
    and their sole objective is to destroy you.  Fortunately for you, their
    creator has focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result
    the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. Your superior wit and
    a fancy teleportation device are your only weapons against the never-ending
    stream of mindless automatons.

    This package is part of the KDE games module.
