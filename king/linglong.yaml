    interactive system for three-dimensional vector graphics
    KiNG (Kinemage, Next Generation) is an interactive system for
    three-dimensional vector graphics. It supports a set of graphics
    primitives that make it suitable for many types of graphs, plots, and
    other illustrations; although its first use was to display
    macromolecular structures for biophysical research. KiNG builds on Mage,
    JavaMage, and the "kinemage" (kinetic image) concept to deliver a
    full-featured Java application with a user-friendly interface and
    integrated editing features. The KiNG jar file can be used within a web
    page as a Java applet or Java object to promote easy access to kinemages
    or coordinate files from a web browser.
