    GUI to easily get an image from a LaTeX formula or equation
    With klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
    of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
    directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
    presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
    in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.
