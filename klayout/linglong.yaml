    High Performance Layout Viewer and Editor
    This is very good viewer for GDSII and other layout files used in the
    semiconductor industry.

    It is similar to 'magic', but has a much more modern GUI and is more robust
    handling all kinds of GDSII files created by various other tools. Its focus is
    more on viewing than on editing, but it also has limited, but expanding,
    support for DRC and extraction for LVS.
