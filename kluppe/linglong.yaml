    loop-player and recorder designed for live use
    kluppe is written in c and uses jack, gtk and sndfile. Features include:

    - multiple files buffers, multiple 'loopers' tracks
    - direct (gui) access to all loopers
    - combined and per loop output ports for jack
    - different playmodes including "granular"

    kluppe is the Austrian word for clip and sounds even crazier if you loop it.
