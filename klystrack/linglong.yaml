    Chiptune tracker
    This is an application for creating music reminiscent of the style of music
    from 8-bit computers or, chiptunes. It features a "tracker" style sequencer,
    and a built-in synthesizer capable of a wide range sounds - including but not
    limited to basic subtractive synthesis, frequency modulation and sample
    playback. Sounds can be easily beefed up by using the effect chain. It is
    possbile to import a handful of file formats, including Protracker .MOD,
    Fasttracker 2 .XM, the Cave Story music format (.ORG) and Rob Hubbard
    Commodore 64 SID files. Tunes can be easily exported as a single mixdown .WAV
    or separate tracks or you can simply use the playback library to use the
    klystrack files in your own games and other software.
