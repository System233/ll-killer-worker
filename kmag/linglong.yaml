    screen magnifier tool
    KDE's screen magnifier tool.

    You can use KMagnifier to magnify a part of the screen just as you would use
    a lens to magnify a newspaper fine-print or a photograph.  This application is
    useful for a variety of people: from researchers to artists to web-designers to
    people with low vision.

    This package is part of the KDE accessibility module.
