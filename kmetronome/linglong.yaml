    ALSA MIDI Metronome
    KMetronome is a MIDI based metronome using the ALSA sequencer.

    The intended audience are musicians and music students. Like the solid, real
    metronomes it is a tool to keep the rhythm while playing musical instruments.

    It uses MIDI for sound generation instead of digital audio, allowing low CPU
    usage and very accurate timing thanks to the ALSA sequencer
