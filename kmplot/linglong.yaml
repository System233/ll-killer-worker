    mathematical function plotter for KDE
    KmPlot is a powerful mathematical plotter KDE, capable of plotting multiple
    functions simultaneously and combining them into new functions.

    Cartesian, parametric, and differential functions are supported, as well as
    functions using polar coordinates.  Plots are printed with high precision at
    the correct aspect ratio.

    KmPlot also provides numerical and visual features such as filling and
    calculating the area between the plot and the first axis, finding maxima and
    minima, changing function parameters dynamically, and plotting derivatives
    and integral functions.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
