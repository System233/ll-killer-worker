    game of space battle
    Kobo Deluxe is a third person scrolling 2D shooter with a simple
    and responsive control system - which you'll need to tackle the
    tons of enemy ships that shoot at you, chase you, circle around
    you shooting, or even launch other ships at you, while you're
    trying to destroy the labyrinth shaped bases. There are 50
    action packed levels with smoothly increasing difficulty, and
    different combinations of enemies that require different tactics
    to be dealt with successfully. It's loads of classical arcade style
    fun.
