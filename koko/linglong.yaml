    Koko is an image viewer designed for desktop and touch devices.

    It is based on Kirigami, being therefore able to adapt nicely to desktops,
    phones, big screens and potentially everything else.

    It features a gallery and an image viewer, plus the chance to do simple
    image modifications (crop, rotation) in-app thanks to the kquickimageeditor.
