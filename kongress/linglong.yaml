    companion application for conferences made by KDE
    Kongress provides practical information about conferences. It supports
    conferences that offer their schedule in iCalendar format. In Kongress, the
    data of the talks are shown in various ways, e.g. in daily views, by talk
    category, etc. The users can also create a list of favorite conference
    talks/events as well as they can navigate to the web page of each talk. A map
    of the conference venue, location information and link to OpenStreetMap can
    also be added.
