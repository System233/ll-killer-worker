    calendar and personal organizer
    This package contains KOrganizer, a calendar and scheduling program.

    KOrganizer aims to be a complete program for organizing appointments,
    contacts, projects, etc. KOrganizer natively supports information interchange
    with other calendar applications, through the industry standard vCalendar
    personal data interchange file format. This eases the move from other
    modern PIMs to KOrganizer.
