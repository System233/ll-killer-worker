    tool for indexing, searching and viewing images by keywords for KDE
    KPhotoAlbum lets you index, search, group and view images by keywords, date,
    locations and persons. It provides a quick and elegant way to lookup groups of
    images when you have thousands of pictures on your hard disk.

    The information associated with each photo is stored in an XML file. Together
    with its keywords, KPhotoAlbum stores each picture's MD5 sum, so it will
    recognize them even if you move them to another directory. KPhotoAlbum can
    also create HTML galleries with the images you select.

    KPhotoAlbum can also make use of the KIPI image handling plugins to extend its
    capabilities. The kipi-plugins package contains many useful extensions. Among
    others, it contains extensions for photo manipulation, importing, exporting
    and batch processing.
