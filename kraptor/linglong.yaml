    After years of oppression, the slaved people of the world have raised
    against their masters. You, a mercenary pilot, have been contacted by the
    popular rebellion to fight against the forces of oppression. In the morning
    you jump into your cockpit and start up the engines. It's time to get airborne
    and start the attack. Get ready to defeat the scum hired by the masters.
    Fighting for freedom is the only way, you're on a mission, don't defraud us...
