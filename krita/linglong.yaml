    pixel-based image manipulation program
    Krita is a creative application for raster images. Whether you want to create
    from scratch or work with existing images, Krita is for you. You can work with
    photos or scanned images, or start with a blank slate. Krita supports most
    graphics tablets out of the box.

    Krita is different from other graphics design programs in that it has
    pluggable brush engines, some supporting brush resources like Gimp brush files,
    others offering sophisticated simulation of real brushes, and others again
    offering color mixing and image deformations. Moreover, Krita has full
    support for graphics tablets, including such features as pressure, tilt and
    rate, making it a great choice for artists. There are easy to use tools for
    drawing lines, ellipses and rectangles, and the freehand tool is supported by
    pluggable "drawing assistants" that help you draw shapes that still have a
    freehand feeling to them.
