    tool to crop PDF files
    Krop is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files.
    A unique feature of krop is its ability to automatically split
    pages into subpages to fit the limited screen size of devices such as
    eReaders. This is particularly useful, if your eReader does not support
    convenient scrolling.
