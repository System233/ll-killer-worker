    twin-panel (commander-style) file manager
    Krusader is a simple, easy, powerful, twin-panel (commander-style) file
    manager, similar to Midnight Commander (C) or Total Commander (C).

    It provides all the file management features you could possibly want.

    Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP,
    advanced search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation,
    file content comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much more.

    It supports archive formats: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, iso, lha, rar, rpm, tar,
    zip and 7-zip.

    It handles KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://.

    Almost completely customizable, Krusader is very user friendly, fast and looks
    great on your desktop.
