    AT&T KornShell
    KornShell is an interactive UNIX command interpreter as well as a POSIX
    compliant scripting language which is a superset of sh(1), the System
    V UNIX shell.

    The ksh93 version of KornShell has the functionality of other scripting
    languages such as AWK, Icon, Perl, Rexx, Tcl and is a full-featured,
    expressive scripting language which complies with POSIX.2 Shell and
    Utilities (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992).

    The KornShell language was designed and developed by David G. Korn at
    AT&T Bell Laboratories and AT&T Research.
