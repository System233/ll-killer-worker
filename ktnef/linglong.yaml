    Viewer for mail attachments using TNEF format
    The TNEF File Viewer allows one to handle easily mail attachments using
    the TNEF format. Those attachments are usually found in mails coming from
    Microsoft mail servers and embed the mail properties as well as the actual
    attachments.

    An attachment in TNEF format is most often named winmail.dat or win.dat.
