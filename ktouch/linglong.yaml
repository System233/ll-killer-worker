    touch typing tutor for KDE
    KTouch is an aid for learning how to type with speed and accuracy.  It
    provides a sample text to type and indicates which fingers should be used for
    each key.

    A collection of lessons are included for a wide range of different languages
    and keyboard layouts, and typing statistics are used to dynamically adjust the
    level of difficulty.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
