    educational programming environment
    KTurtle is an educational programming environment which uses the TurtleScript
    programming language (inspired by Logo) to make programming as easy and
    accessible as possible.

    The user issues TurtleScript language commands to control the "turtle", which
    draws on the canvas, making KTurtle suitable for teaching elementary
    mathematics, geometry and programming.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
