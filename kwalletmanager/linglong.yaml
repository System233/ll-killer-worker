    secure password wallet manager
    The KDE Wallet system provides a secure way to store passwords and other
    secret information, allowing the user to remember only a single KDE Wallet
    password instead of numerous different passwords and credentials.

    KWallet Manager is a utility for viewing and editing information stored in
    the KDE Wallet.

    This package is part of the KDE SC utilities module.
