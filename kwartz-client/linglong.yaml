    Configuration of a Kwartz client
    Kwartz is a school server featuring many services, deployed in French
    schools. This package makes it easier for sysadmins to integrate a
    GNU-Linux client machine in a network ruled by a Kwartz service, to
    allow users to authenticate against the LDAP directory, auto-mount
    Samba shares for themselves, and for the groups and projects they
    belong to.
