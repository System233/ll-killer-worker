    KDE window manager data files
    KWin (pronounced as one syllable "kwin") is the window
    manager for the KDE Plasma Desktop. It gives you complete
    control over your windows, making sure they're not in the way
    but aid you in your task. It paints the window decoration,
    the bar on top of every window with (configurable) buttons
    like close, maximize and minimize. It also handles placing
    of windows and switching between them.
