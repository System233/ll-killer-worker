    interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data
    LabPlot provides an easy way to create, manage and edit plots.  It allows you
    to produce plots based on data from a spreadsheet or on data imported from
    external files.  Plots can be exported to several pixmap and vector graphic
    formats.

    Features include:
    - project-based management of data
    - project explorer for management and organization of created objects in
    different folders and sub-folders
    - spreadsheet with basic functionality for manual data entry or for
    generation of uniform and non-uniform random numbers
    - import of external ASCII data into the project for further editing and
    visualization
    - export of spreadsheet to an ASCII file
    - worksheet as the main parent object for plots, labels, etc; supports
    different layouts and zooming functions
    - export of worksheet to different formats (PDF, EPS, PNG, and SVG)
    - great variety of editing capabilities for properties of worksheet and its
    objects
    - cartesian plots, created either from imported or manually created data
    sets or via mathematical equation
    - definition of mathematical formulas is supported by syntax highlighting
    and completion and by the list of thematically grouped mathematical and
    physical constants and functions
    - analysis of plotted data is supported by many zooming and navigation
    features
    - linear and non-linear fits to data, several fit-models are predefined and
    custom models with arbitrary number of parameters can be provided
