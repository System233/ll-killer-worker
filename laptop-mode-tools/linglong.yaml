    Tools for Power Savings based on battery/AC status
    Laptop mode is a Linux kernel feature that allows your laptop to save
    considerable power, by allowing the hard drive to spin down for longer
    periods of time. This package contains the userland scripts that are
    needed to enable laptop mode.

    It includes support for automatically enabling laptop mode when the
    computer is working on batteries. It also supports various other power
    management features, such as starting and stopping daemons depending on
    power mode, automatically hibernating if battery levels are too low, and
    adjusting terminal blanking and X11 screen blanking

    laptop-mode-tools uses the Linux kernel's Laptop Mode feature and thus
    is also used on Desktops and Servers to conserve power
