    simple game of capturing balls
    This is a simple and fun game, which involves using your mouse
    based guillotine to trap bouncing balls.

    Trapping balls is achieved by firing your guillotine to split the
    playing area into little boxes, once enough of the screen has been
    covered you progress to the next level.
