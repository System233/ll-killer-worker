    IDE for Free Pascal - common IDE files
    Lazarus is an IDE to create (graphical and console) applications with Free
    Pascal, the (L)GPLed Pascal and Object Pascal compiler that runs on
    Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and more.

    Lazarus is the missing part of the puzzle that will allow you to develop
    programs for all of the above platforms in a Delphi-like environment.
    The IDE is a RAD tool that includes a form designer.

    Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
    strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
    is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
    to produce identical products for different platforms.

    In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus
    Component Library (LCL).

    This package contains the common files required to run Lazarus IDE.
