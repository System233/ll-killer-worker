    ball-and-paddle game
    LBreakoutHD is a remaster of LBreakout2, a game similar to Breakout
    and xboing. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen,
    and uses it to bounce one or more balls which destroy bricks; the
    paddle can also be used to collect various extras with positive or
    negative effects.

    LBreakoutHD supports all LBreakout2 themes and level sets.
