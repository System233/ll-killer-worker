    user-friendly, powerful music visualization / VJing tool
    Le Biniou works with music, voice, ambient sounds, whatever acoustic
    source you choose.

    When you run Le Biniou it gives an evolutionary rendering of the
    sound you are playing.

    You are given two options to run Le Biniou: You can manage entirely
    the sequences and choose your own series of images from the default
    library, your colour scales, the kind of alteration you want to apply
    or you can let Le Biniou's artificial intelligence run on its own.

    Forget the old visualizations you are familiar with, discover a new
    multidimensional – spatial and chromatic – way of comprehending music
    and sounds for either artistic, recreational or didactic purposes.
