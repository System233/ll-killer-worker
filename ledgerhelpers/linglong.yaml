    collection of helper programs and a helper library for ledger
    This is a collection of small single-purpose programs to aid your accounting
    with ledger. Think of it as the batteries that were never included with
    ledger. What can you do with these programs:

    - Enter transactions easily with addtrans.
    - Record multi-currency ATM withdrawals with withdraw-cli.
    - Record FIFO stock or commodity sales with sellstock-cli.
    - Interactively clear transactions with cleartrans-cli.
    - Keep your ledger chronologically sorted with sorttrans-cli.
