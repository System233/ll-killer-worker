    strategy game in the tradition of Panzer General
    LGeneral is a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Panzer General.
    You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn against a human
    player or the AI.

    Entrenchment, rugged defense, defensive fire, surprise contacts, surrender,
    unit supply, weather influence, reinforcements and other implementations
    contribute to the tactical and strategic depth of the game.

    This is the game engine only. LGeneral requires lgeneral-data or lgc-pg, which
    converts the game data of the original Panzer General game, to function
    properly.
