    Flatpak portal library (test program for GTK 4)
    libportal provides GIO-style C APIs for most Flatpak portals' D-Bus
    interfaces. It is primarily intended for installation in Flatpak runtimes,
    where applications can use it to interact with portals; it can also be
    used to test the portal services.

    See the xdg-desktop-portal package's description for more information
    about portals.

    This package contains the org.gnome.PortalTest.Gtk4 application, and
    will contain "as-installed" test programs if they are added.
