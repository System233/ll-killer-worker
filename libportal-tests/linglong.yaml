    Flatpak portal library (test program)
    libportal provides GIO-style C APIs for most Flatpak portals' D-Bus
    interfaces. It is primarily intended for installation in Flatpak runtimes,
    where applications can use it to interact with portals; it can also be
    used to test the portal services.

    See the xdg-desktop-portal package's description for more information
    about portals.

    This package contains the portal-test application, and will contain
    "as-installed" test programs if they are added.
