    build & maintain a city/country
    You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
    provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
    economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
    broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
    starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
    one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.
    This game is similar to the commercial simulation game with a similar
    name.
