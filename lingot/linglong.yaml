    accurate and easy to use musical instrument tuner
    Lingot is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and
    highly configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars,
    it can now be used to tune any instrument.

    It looks like an analogic tuner, with a gauge indicating the relative
    shift to a certain note indicating that note and its frequency.
