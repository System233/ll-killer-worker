    graphical wireless scanner
    LinSSID is a graphical program that displays locally receivable 802.11
    wireless attach points and ad hoc networks.

    A table is displayed with various parameters such as MAC address, channel,
    and signal strength. Graphs are also displayed with signal strength by
    channel and signal strength over time.

    LinSSID is graphically and functionally similar to inSSIDer (for Microsoft
    Windows) and Wi-Fi Analyzer (for Android).

    LinSSID can be used to measure the local performance or to search for an
    interference free channel to be set in a wireless router (access point or
    AP). The wireless established link won't be affected by these operations
    because LinSSID needn't set the monitor mode in network interface.

    Some features:

    - Table of locally receivable attach points with many columns of different
    information and sortable and movable columns.
    - Adjustable speed, real-time update.
    - Graphs of signal strength by channel and over time.
    - AP bandwidth displayed.
    - Works on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels.
