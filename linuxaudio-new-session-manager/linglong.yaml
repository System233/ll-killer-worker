    Music production session manager
    New Session Manager (NSM) is a tool to assist music production by grouping
    standalone programs into sessions. Your workflow becomes easy to manage,
    robust and fast by leveraging the full potential of cooperative applications.

    You can create a session, or project, add programs to it and then use commands
    to save, start/stop, hide/show all programs at once, or individually. At a
    later date you can then re-open the session and continue where you left off.

    All files belonging to the session will be saved in the same directory.
