    truly original multiplayer wargame
    Liquid War is an original multiplayer wargame. There are no weapons, the only
    thing you have to do is to move a cursor in a 2-D battlefield. This cursor is
    followed by your army, which is composed by a  great many little fighters,
    represented by small colored squares. When fighters from different teams meet,
    they eat each other, it is as simple as that.

    A single player mode is available, but the game is definitely designed to be
    multiplayer, and has network support.
