    Keyboard with configurable layout and transparency
    Literki is a full qwerty keyboard with configurable layout and
    always-on functionality by usage of transparency. Applications
    do not need to redraw and popping up the keyboard is therefore
    very fast.

    In addition to keyboard, literki comes with touchpad and scroll
    buttons.
