  description: |-
    game where you build figures out of colored marbles
    The goal of this game is to create a more or less complex figure
    out of single marbles within a time limit to reach the next level.
    Sounds easy? Well, there is a problem: If a marble starts to move,
    it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble.
