  description: |-
    graphical tool for designing and simulating logic circuits
    Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic
    circuits. With its simple toolbar interface and simulation of circuits as
    you build them, it is simple enough to facilitate learning the most basic
    concepts related to logic circuits. With the capacity to build larger circuits
    from smaller subcircuits, and to draw bundles of wires with a single mouse
    drag, Logisim can be used (and is used) to design and simulate entire CPUs
    for educational purposes.
