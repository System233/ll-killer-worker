    Scripts and mocks for running Lomiri Shell tests
    Lomiri is an operating environment optimized for touch based
    human-machine interaction, but also supporting convergence (i.e.
    switching between tablet/phone and desktop mode). Lomiri is the user
    shell driving Ubuntu Touch based mobile devices.

    This package provides fake implementations of some QML modules used by
    the Lomiri Shell (e.g. Lomiri.Application) so that you can run it in a
    sandboxed environment; it also provides scripts to run its test suite.
