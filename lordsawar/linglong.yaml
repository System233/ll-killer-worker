    Clone of the popular SSG game Warlords II
    A 2d turn-based strategy game where up to 8 players strive for control
    of as many cities as possible. Produce new armies in cities to conquer
    nearby cities. Using the income from those cities, make more armies to
    take more cities. Send a hero to a temple to get a quest, or maybe search
    a nearby ruin instead. Game should run well on modest hardware.

    Play with others or against the computer.
