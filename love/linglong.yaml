    2D game development framework based on Lua and OpenGL
    LÃ–VE was created to be a user-friendly engine in which simple (or
    complicated) games could be made without having extensive knowledge
    of system or graphics functions and without having to dedicate time
    towards developing the same engine features time and time again.

    Developed with cross-platform implementation in mind, it utilizes the
    latest open source libraries to deliver a similar game experience,
    independent of operating system. By relying on the Lua scripting language
    for game-specific programming, it allows even the novice game creator to
    quickly and efficiently develop an idea into a fully working game.
