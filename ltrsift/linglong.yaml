  description: |-
    postprocessing and classification of LTR retrotransposons
    LTRsift is a graphical desktop tool for semi-automatic postprocessing of de
    novo predicted LTR retrotransposon annotations, such as the ones generated by
    LTRharvest and LTRdigest. Its user-friendly interface displays LTR
    retrotransposon candidates, their putative families and their internal
    structure in a hierarchical fashion, allowing the user to "sift" through the
    sometimes large results of de novo prediction software. It also offers
    customizable filtering and classification functionality.
