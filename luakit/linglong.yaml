    fast and small web browser extensible by Lua
    Luakit is a highly-configurable browser framework based on WebKitGTK+.
    It is very fast and extensible by Lua.  It is primarily targeted at power
    users, developers and any people with too much time on their hands who
    want to have fine-grained control over their web browser's behaviour and
    interface.
