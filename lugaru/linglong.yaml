    third person ninja rabbit fighting game
    Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action game.
    The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with
    impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for
    slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the
    corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby
    den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his
    fellow rabbits from slavery.

    Lugaru HD is developed by the OSS Lugaru project and is based on the original
    Lugaru HD by Wolfire Games.
