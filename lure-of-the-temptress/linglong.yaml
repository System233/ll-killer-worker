    classic 2D point and click fantasy adventure game
    Lure of the Temptress was Revolution's very first adventure game and work
    began on it in 1989, even before Revolution's inception as an actual games
    development company.

    You are Diermot, an unwilling hero who'd prefer a quiet life, and are, to all
    intents and purposes, a good man. After decades of unrest the King has united
    the warring factions in his kingdom and all his lands are at peace, except a
    remote region around a town called Turnvale. A revolt has recently taken place
    in Turnvale, a revolt orchestrated by an apprentice sorceress called Selena,
    the titular temptress.
    The king calls together his finest horsemen and heads off (with you in tow) to
    Turnvale just to witness how hellish mercenary monsters called Skorl are
    invading the town.

    The king's men are defeated, the king is killed and you fall of your horse
    and bang your head heavily on the ground. You have been unconscious for a
    while when you realize that you are in a dingy cell guarded by a not so
    friendly Skorl. Maybe it would be an idea to try and escape...

    Note that this package only contains game-data. The game engine is provided by
