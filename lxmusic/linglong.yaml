    LXDE music player
    LXMusic is a GUI application for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
    (LXDE).

    It is a minimalist music player based on xmms2 and has server/client design.
    The user interface is quite simple, clean, and intuitive. At first glance, it
    looks similar to one of the famous players on Windows - foobar 2000.
