    Debian branding for LXQt
    LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
    technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and
    an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, LXQt also works
    fine with less powerful machines.

    The branding package contains misc. downstream configurations for LXQt.
