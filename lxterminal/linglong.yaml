    LXDE terminal emulator
    LXTerminal is a VTE-based terminal emulator for the Lightweight X11 Desktop
    Environment (LXDE).

    It supports multiple tabs and has only minimal dependencies thus being
    completely desktop-independent. In order to reduce memory usage and increase
    the performance, all instances of the terminal are sharing a single process.
