  description: |-
    GNUstep app for processing planetary astronomical images
    Lynkeos is an application dedicated to the processing of astronomical
    (mainly planetary) images taken with a webcam through a telescope.
    By stacking the best images, the signal to noise ratio is increased
    and details lost in the noise of individual images become visible in
    the resulting image.
