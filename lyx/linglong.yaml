    document processor
    LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX. It makes the power and
    typesetting quality of LaTeX available for people who are used to
    word processors. Since LyX supports LaTeX's concept of general
    mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create professional quality
    documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also
    possible to use LaTeX commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's
    power is lost.

    You can extend the functionality of LyX by installing these packages:
    * chktex: check for typographical errors
    * gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents
    * groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports
    * gnumeric: import spreadsheats
    * librsvg2-bin, inkscape: use the SVG image format in LyX documents
    * lilypond: support for musical sheets
    * maxima: integrated CAS support for equation evaluation
    * mythes-*: use the OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Thesaurus
    * noweb, r-cran-knitr: use literate programming
    * rcs, cvs, svn, git: integrated version control
    * texlive-xetex/luatex: use the XeTeX/LuaTeX typesetting system
    * wv: import MS Word documents
    * xsltproc (or saxon with openjdk-17-jre), docbook-xsl: ePub export
