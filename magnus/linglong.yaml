    Very simple screen magnifier
    Magnus is a simple screen magnifying glass. It nicely integrates with
    X11 desktops like MATE or Xfce (probably with others not named here,
    too).

    Visually impaired users may find this tool helpful for zooming into
    certain screen areas in order to improve readability/visibilty of fonts,
    icons and other data.
