    Original Mah-Jong game
    This is a set of programs to play the original Mah-Jong game: one
    server, one client for a human player and one client for an AI
    player. Hence the game can be played by 1 to 4 human players.

    You should keep in mind that the original Mah-Jong game has nothing
    to do with the well-known solitaire game. (It merely uses the same
    set of tiles.)

    If you like the game, please consider making a donation to the
    (upstream) author. Read /usr/share/doc/mah-jong/README.Debian for
    details.
