    GUI to configure malcontent
    malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible
    to non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is used,
    a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
    administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
    will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
    being too violent.

    This is not a security boundary, and a sufficiently technically advanced user
    may always work around these parental controls. malcontent is not a mandatory
    access control (MAC) system like AppArmor or SELinux. However, its correct use
    by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or
    accidentally having access to content which they shouldnâ€™t.

    This package contains the GUI to configure malcontent.
