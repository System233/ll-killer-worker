    virtual on-screen keyboard based on the Maliit Framework
    Maliit Keyboard is a virtual keyboard for Linux systems with Wayland and
    X11 display servers. It supports many different languages and emoji. It
    is implemented as a plug-in for Maliit Framework.

    Maliit Keyboard evolved from the reference keyboard plug-in, Ubuntu
    Keyboard and Lomiri Keyboard. Ubuntu Keyboard was a fork of the
    reference plugin which was taking into account the special UI/UX needs
    of Ubuntu Phone.
