    Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME)
    MAME is a hardware emulator: it faithfully reproduces the behavior of many
    arcade machines (it is not a simulation). This program is not a game but can
    directly, through ROM images, run the complete system of these old arcade
    machines. These ROMs are subject to copyright and it is in most of the cases
    illegal to use them if you do not own the arcade machine.

    This package provides the MAME binary and configuration files.
