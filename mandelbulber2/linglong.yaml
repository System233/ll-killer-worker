    3D fractal renderer and animator
    Mandelbulber2 is a ray-tracing application for drawing three-dimensional
    fractals, like Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, Julia, trigonometric, hypercomplex
    or IFS fractals. It is highly customizable and features complex shading
    algorithms (among the others there are shadows, depth of field, ambient
    occlusion).

    Mandelbulber2 is also able to produce animations and has a simple
    built-in 3D navigator for exploring the fractals.
