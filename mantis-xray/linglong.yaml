    Multivariate ANalysis Tool for x-ray Spectromicroscopy
    Spectromicroscopy combines spectral data with microscopy, where
    typical datasets consist of a stack of microscopic images taken
    across an energy range. Due to the data complexity, manual analysis
    can be time consuming and inefficient, whereas multivariate analysis
    tools not only reduce the time needed but also can uncover hidden
    trends in the data.

    Mantis is Multivariate ANalysis Tool for Spectromicroscopy developed
    in Python by 2nd Look Consulting. It uses principal component
    analysis and cluster analysis to classify pixels according to
    spectral similarity.
