    photo viewer and organizer with emphasis on IPTC fields
    Cross-platform (UNIX, Mac OS X, and Windows) picture manager and organizer,
    Mapivi is a stand alone tool, there is no need for a web server, online
    access or a database.

    Deals with EXIF data (like timestamp, camera model, focal length, exposure
    time, aperture, etc.), and is able to rename the pictures according to their
    internal date/time, to display and modify JPEG comments and to do lossless
    rotation.

    The idea of using Mapivi as an picture organizer is to keep user, EXIF, and
    IPTC information where it belongs -- in the pictures -- as well in a
    searchable Mapivi database.

    Mapivi is also able to do image processing. Mapivi serves here as a
    frontend (GUI) for many proven command line tools, like the Image Magick
    tools.
