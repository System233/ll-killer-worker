    globe and map widget (no KDE dependencies)
    Marble is a generic geographical map widget and framework for KDE
    applications. The Marble widget shows the earth as a sphere but does not
    require hardware acceleration.  A minimal set of geographical data is
    included, so it can be used without an internet connection.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
