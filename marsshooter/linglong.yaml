    ridiculous space shooter governed by the laws of gravity
    M.A.R.S is a two-dimensional space shooter game with excellent 2D-graphics, a
    stunning amount of particles and shader support. It offers single- and
    multiplayer gameplay, many impressive weapons and specials and customizable
    ships.

    In the year 3547 civilizations across the galaxy have settled their own
    planets, living in peace and harmony with its environment. But outside the
    placid habitats, the GREAT WAR is raging. As a famous fighter on your way to
    never ending honor and prosperity, you have to protect your planet from the
    imminent doom of your jealous neighbours!
