  description: |-
    polymer chemistry modelling and mass spectrometry data simulation (runtime)
    massXpert2 allows the user to perform the following tasks:

    - Make brand new polymer chemistry definitions;
    - Use the definitions to easily perform calculations in a desktop
    calculator-like manner;
    - Perform sophisticated polymer sequence editing and simulations;
    - Perform m/z list comparisons;
    - Perform isotopic cluster simulations.

    Chemical simulations encompass cleavage (either chemical or
    enzymatic), gas-phase fragmentations, chemical modification of any
    monomer in the polymer sequence, cross-linking of monomers in the
    sequence, arbitrary mass searches...

    This package ships the massXpert2 program.
