    utilities to configure the MATE desktop
    The MATE control center contains configuration applets for the MATE desktop,
    allowing to set accessibility configuration, desktop fonts, keyboard
    and mouse properties, sound setup, desktop theme and background, user
    interface properties, screen resolution, and other MATE parameters.

    It also contains a front end to these applets, which can also be
    accessed with the MATE panel or the Caja file manager.
