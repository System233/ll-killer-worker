    Library with common API for various MATE modules
    The MATE component mate-desktop contains the libmate-desktop library, the
    mate-about program, as well as some desktop-wide documents.

    The libmate-desktop library provides an API shared by several applications
    on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
    reasons.

    The mate-about program helps with finding which version of MATE is installed.

    NOTE: This package does not install the complete MATE desktop environment
    for you. The full desktop environment can be installed via the metapackage
    mate-desktop-environment.
