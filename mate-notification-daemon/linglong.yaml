    daemon to display passive popup notifications
    mate-notification-daemon displays passive popup notifications, as per
    the Desktop Notifications Specification.

    The Desktop Notifications Specification provides a standard way of
    doing passive popup notifications on the Linux desktop. These are
    designed to notify the user of something without interrupting their
    work with a dialog box that they must close.  Passive popups can
    automatically disappear after a short period of time, as per the
    Desktop Notifications spec.
