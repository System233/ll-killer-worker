    launcher and docking facility for MATE
    The MATE Panel is an essential part of the MATE Desktop, providing
    toolbar-like “panels” which can be attached to the sides of your desktop.
    They are used to launch applications and embed a number of other
    functions, such as quick launch icons, the clock, the notification area,
    volume controls and the battery charge indicator, and utilities ranging
    from weather forecast to system monitoring.
