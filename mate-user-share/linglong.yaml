    User level public file sharing via WebDAV
    MATE user share is a small tool that binds together various free
    software projects to bring easy to use user-level file sharing to the
    masses.

    The program is meant to run in the background when the user is logged
    in, and when file sharing is enabled a webdav server is started that
    shares the $HOME/Public folder. The share is then published to all
    computers on the local network using mDNS/rendezvous, so that it shows
    up in the Network location in GNOME.

    The dav server used is Apache, so you need that installed. Avahi or
    Howl is used for mDNS support, so you need to have that installed and
    mDNSResolver running.
