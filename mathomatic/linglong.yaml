    portable Computer Algebra System (CAS)
    Mathomatic implements most of the rules of algebra for the
    mathematical operators +, -, *, /, % (modulus), and power (including
    roots).

    Mathomatic can symbolically:

    * combine and solve equations,
    * completely simplify and compare expressions and equations,
    * do simple calculus transformations and series,
    * do standard, complex number, modular, and polynomial arithmetic,
    * generate optimized C, Java, and Python language code from
    simplified equations,
    * plot expressions with gnuplot in two or three dimensions,
    * do quick calculations, colorize expressions, etc.
