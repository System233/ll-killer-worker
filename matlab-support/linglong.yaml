    distro integration for local MATLAB installations
    This package does not provide MATLAB. Instead, it configures an
    existing MATLAB installation to integrate more comfortably in
    a Debian installation.

    Currently it provides /usr/bin/matlab through the alternatives
    system, offers to work around incompatibilities between the libraries
    bundled with MATLAB and system libraries, and provides a helper
    utility meant to be used by other packages to compile MEX extensions.

    Install this if you would like your MATLAB installation to behave more
    like an ordinary Debian package. Other packages may depend on
    this one if they install MATLAB code, for example in order to
    compile MEX extensions.
