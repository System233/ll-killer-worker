    multiple genome alignment
    Mauve is a system for efficiently constructing multiple genome alignments
    in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement
    and inversion. Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research
    into comparative genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics.  Aligning
    whole genomes is a fundamentally different problem than aligning short
    sequences.

    Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner
    should require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic
    techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence being aligned. For
    example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute,
    while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in
    a few hours.

    Mauve computes and interactively visualizes genome sequence comparisons.
    Using FastA or GenBank sequence data, Mauve constructs multiple genome
    alignments that identify large-scale rearrangement, gene gain, gene loss,
    indels, and nucleotide substutition.

    Mauve is developed at the University of Wisconsin.
