    Midnight Commander - a powerful file manager
    GNU Midnight Commander is a text-mode full-screen file manager. It
    uses a two panel interface and a subshell for command execution. It
    includes an internal editor with syntax highlighting and an internal
    viewer with support for binary files. Also included is Virtual
    Filesystem (VFS), that allows files on remote systems (e.g. FTP, SSH
    servers) and files inside archives to be manipulated like real files.
