    GTK+ image viewer for comic books
    MComix is an user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
    designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer.
    It reads images in ZIP, RAR, 7Zip or tar archives as well as plain image
    files. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings,
    and runs on both Linux and Windows.

    MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes
    and stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late
    2009.
