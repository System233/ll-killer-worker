    GNUstep Finder and system-wide search system
    MDFinder is a an application to search items already indexed by the
    GWMetadata indexing system, a GNUstep implementation of MacOS X's
    proprietary Spotlight.  Searches can be saved and are automatically
    updated if the corresponding files change.  Indexing is done in the
    background and is switched off by default.  To enable it and
    configure the search path, use the dedicated module in
    the SystemPreferences application.
