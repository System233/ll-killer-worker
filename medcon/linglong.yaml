    Medical Image (DICOM, ECAT, ...) conversion tool
    This project stands for Medical Image Conversion. Released under the
    (L)GPL, it comes with the full C-source code of the library, a
    flexible command line utility and a neat graphical front-end using
    the GTK+ toolkit. The currently supported formats are: Acr/Nema 2.0,
    Analyze (SPM), DICOM 3.0, InterFile 3.3 and PNG.

    The program also allows one to read unsupported files without
    compression, to print pixel values or to extract/reorder specified
    images. It is possible to retrieve the raw binary/ascii image arrays
    or to write PNG for desktop applications.

    This is the command line tool for batch processing.
