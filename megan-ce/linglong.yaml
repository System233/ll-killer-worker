    interactive tool to explore and analyse microbiome sequencing data
    MEGAN Community Edition is a shotgun sequencer to analyze microbiome samples.
    It is a rewrite and extension of the widely-used microbiome analysis tool
    MEGAN so as to facilitate the interactive analysis of the taxonomic and
    functional content of very large microbiome datasets. Other new features
    include a functional classifier called InterPro2GO, gene-centric read
    assembly, principal coordinate analysis of taxonomy and function, and support
    for metadata.  By integrating MEGAN CE with the high-throughput DNA-to-protein
    alignment tool DIAMOND a powerful and complete pipeline for the analysis of
    metagenome shotgun sequences can be provided.
