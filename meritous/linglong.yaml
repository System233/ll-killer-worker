    action-adventure dungeon crawl game
    Far below the surface of the planet is a secret.  A place of limitless
    power. Those that seek to control such a utopia will soon bring an end
    to themselves. Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him, PSI
    user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus Dome in search of answers.

    Meritous is a action-adventure game with simple controls but a
    challenge to find a balance of power verses recovery time during
    real-time battles. Set in a procedurally generated world, the player
    can explore thousands of rooms in search of powerful artifacts, tools
    to help them, and to eventually free the Orcus Dome from evil.
