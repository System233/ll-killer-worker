    Merkuro is a small collection of applications to manage your calendar, your
    mail and your addressbook.

    Merkuro Calendar is a Kirigami based calendar and task management application
    that uses Akonadi. It lets you add, edit and delete events and tasks from
    local and remote accounts  of your choice, while keeping changes synchronised
    across your Plasma desktop or phone.

    Merkuro Contact is a Kirigami based addressbook application.

    Merkuro Mail is a work-in-progress mail application that uses Akonadi. For now,
    it just allows you to read your mail.
