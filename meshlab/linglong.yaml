    System for processing and editing triangular meshes
    This is an open source, portable, and extendible system for the
    processing and editing of unstructured 3D triangular meshes.
    The system is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small
    unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for
    editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind
    of meshes.

    Meshlab can read files in these formats: PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA
    and PTX. It can write PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA, VRML, and DXF.
