    GTK app for viewing and cleaning metadata in files
    Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data about when
    a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office applications automatically
    add author and company information to documents and spreadsheets. Maybe you
    do not want to disclose those information.

    This tool allows you to view metadata in your files and to get rid of them as
    much as possible.

    Under the hood, it relies on mat2 to parse and remove the metadata.
