    hardware & software framework to learn microcontrollers
    This package provides a set of example programs to drive an ATmega32
    microcontroller, together with a tutorqial explaining how to compile
    them, upload them to the microcontroller, and how to make simple and
    more complicated modifications. It is meant to be used with the
    "microhope" board which makes it easy to upload code to the microcontroller
    through a USB link.

    In addition to examples there is a library to drive all of the peripherals
    available on the "microhope" board: LED, LCD display, ADC connected to
    sensors.

    A Graphic User Interface is provided too.
