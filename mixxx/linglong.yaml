    Digital Disc Jockey Interface
    Mixxx is a digital DJ system, where Wave, Ogg, FLAC and MP3 files can be
    mixed on a computer for use in live performances. Filters, crossfader, and
    speed control are provided. Mixxx can sync the 2 streams automatically, using
    an algorithm to detect the beat.

    Mixxx works with Jack or OSS, can be controlled from the GUI or from external
    controllers, including MIDI devices and joysticks, and supports skins.
