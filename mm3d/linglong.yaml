    OpenGL based 3D model editor
    This is an OpenGL based 3D model editor that works with triangle-based
    models. It supports multi-level undo, skeletal animations, simple texturing,
    scripting, command-line batch processing, and a plugin system for adding new
    model and image filters. Complete online help is included. It is designed to
    be easy to use and easy to extend with plugins and scripts.

    It supports the following 3d files: MilkShape (ms3d), Wavefront (obj),
    LightWave 3d Object (lwo), Quake 2 model (md2), Quake 3 model (md3),
