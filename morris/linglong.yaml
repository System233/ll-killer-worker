    Nine men's morris game
    Morris is an implementation of the board game "Nine Men's Morris".
    Sometimes simply called Mills, Morris, Merrills, or MÃ¼hle in German.
    This implementation supports not only the standard game, but also
    several rule-variants and different boards. The game supports a
    strong computer player which learns from past games played.
