    media player interface (MPRIS2) bridge for MPD
    mpDris2 is an implementation of the MPRIS2 media player interface as a
    client for MPD, allowing MPRIS2 clients to control MPD and observe its
    track changes via a standard D-Bus interface.

    It can also respond to multimedia keys if running under GNOME,
    and send track-change notifications if gir1.2-notify-0.7 is installed.
