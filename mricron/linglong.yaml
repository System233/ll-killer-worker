  description: |-
    magnetic resonance image conversion, viewing and analysis
    This is a GUI-based visualization and analysis tool for (functional) magnetic
    resonance imaging. MRIcron can be used to create 2D or 3D renderings of
    statistical overlay maps on brain anatomy images. Moreover, it aids drawing
    anatomical regions-of-interest (ROI), or lesion mapping, as well as basic
    analysis of functional timeseries (e.g. creating plots of peristimulus
    signal-change).

    In addition to 'mricron', this package also provides 'dcm2nii' that supports
    converting DICOM and PAR/REC images into the NIfTI format, and 'npm' for
    non-parametric data analysis.
