    physics centipede invasion, smashup waggly shmup
    Mu-cade is another shoot-em-up game by Kenta Cho. In this game Kenta has
    introduced physics into his formula of hardcore shooting games. Similar
    in some ways to Asteroids and Nibbles, the playing area is a rectangular
    arena in which vessel-snakes have only one idea at the head: expelling
    the others into the vacuum. You incarnate one of them, and you'll quickly
    realize the subtlety of the goal: your tail lengthens as you destroy your
    enemies.
