    ALSA GUI control tool for Envy24 (ice1712) soundcards
    Mudita24 is a modification of the Linux alsa-tools' envy24control: an
    application controlling the digital mixer, channel gains and other hardware
    settings for sound cards based on the VIA Ice1712 chipset aka Envy24. Unlike
    most ALSA mixer controls, this application displays a level meter for each
    input and output channel and maintains peak level indicators. This is based
    on Envy24's hardware peak metering feature.

    Mudita24 provides alternate name to avoid confusion with "envy24control
    0.6.0" until changes in this version propagate upstream. As balance to the
    "Envy", this project needed some Mudita "In Buddhism the third of the four
    divine abidings is mudita, taking joy in the good fortune of another. This
    virtue is considered the antidote to envy and the opposite of
    schadenfreude."

    This utility is preferable to alsamixer for those with ice1712-based
