    polyphonic, multichannel midi realtime software synthesizer
    The Mx44 is a polyphonic multichannel midi realtime software
    synthesizer. It is written in C and hand optimized for the (Intel) MMX
    instruction set. It runs under Linux, using any kernel modified for
    realtime performance.

    The core algorithm is a  4 x 4 crossmodulating matrix (phase and
    amplitude) with individual envelopes for each oscillator. Oscillators
    have individual frequency intonation, can emphasize any of the eight
    first harmonics and even do some internal crossmodulation. Envelopes
    can be switched between VCA and VCF modes (ehrm, actually wave-shaping,
    but it will quack like a duck by any other name.) The sustainloop of
    the envelope can be brought into oscillation in the audible spectre as
    well as provide slow LFO sweeps. There is also a minor load of key and
    velocity related modifications for wowie zowie realtime ecstacy
    emulation.
