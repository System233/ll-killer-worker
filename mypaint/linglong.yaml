    paint program for use with graphics tablets
    MyPaint is a pressure- and tilt-sensitive painting program which works well
    with Wacom graphics tablets and other similar devices. It comes with a large
    brush collection including charcoal and ink to emulate real media, but the
    highly configurable brush engine allows you to experiment with your own
    brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.

    This package contains the main program.
