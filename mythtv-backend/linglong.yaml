    Personal video recorder application (server)
    MythTV provides a unified graphical interface for recording and viewing
    television programs. Refer to the mythtv package for more information.

    This package contains only the server software, which provides video and
    audio capture and encoding services. In order to be useful, it requires a
    mythtv-frontend installation, either on the same system or one reachable
    via the network.

    A database is also required. The mythtv-database package must be installed,
    either on the same system, or one reachable via the network.

    For a complete installation of all MythTV components, install the 'mythtv'
    package.
