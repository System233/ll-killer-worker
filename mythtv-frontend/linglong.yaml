    Personal video recorder application (client)
    MythTV provides a unified graphical interface for recording and viewing
    television programs. Refer to the mythtv package for more information.

    This package contains only the client software, which provides a front-end
    for playback and configuration. It requires access to a mythtv-backend
    installation, either on the same system or one reachable via the network.

    A database is also required. The mythtv-database package must be installed,
    either on the same system, or one reachable via the network.

    For a complete installation of all MythTV components, install the 'mythtv'
    package.
