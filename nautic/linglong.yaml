    computation of observer position in astro-navigation
    Nautical ephemeris are included until 2030 with no relevant error for
    all navigational bodies, 56 stars, Sun, Moon and 4 major planets.
    The local meridian time can be computed directly from time UT: sextant
    altitude correction is computed automatically after inserting the
    value of height of eye with the correction tables of the Admiralty
    Nautical Almanac.

    A plotting sheet reports the calculated position and bodies' position
    lines.  An info window indicates the body's most important celestial
    parameters.
