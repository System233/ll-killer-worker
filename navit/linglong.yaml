    Car navigation system with routing engine
    Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine.

    Its modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for
    routing and rendering of the displayed map. It's even possible to use multiple
    maps at a time.

    The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen
    displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map.

    The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA
    GPS sensors.

    The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination,
    but also generates directions and even speaks to you using speech-dispatcher.

    The Debian packaging for navit doesn't provide any map. To see, where you can
    get maps from, see <http://wiki.navit-project.org/index.php/Main_Page#Maps>.
