    NCBI libraries for biology applications (X-based utilities)
    This package includes some X-based utilities distributed with the
    NCBI C SDK: Network Entrez, Sequin, ddv, and udv.  These programs
    are not part of ncbi-tools-bin because they depend on several
    additional library packages.
