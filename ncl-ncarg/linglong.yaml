    NCAR Command Language and NCAR graphics
    The NCAR Command Language (NCL) is a free interpreted language designed
    specifically for scientific data processing and visualization. NCL has robust
    file input and output. It can read and write netCDF-3, netCDF-4 classic
    HDF4, HDF5, binary, and ASCII data, and read HDF-EOS2, GRIB1 and
    GRIB2. The graphics are world class and highly customizable.

    The software comes with a couple of useful command line tools:
    * ncl_filedump - prints the contents of supported files (netCDF, HDF,
    GRIB1, GRIB2, HDF-EOS2, and CCM History Tape)
    * ncl_convert2nc - converts one or more GRIB1, GRIB2, HDF and/or HDF-EOS
    iles to netCDF formatted files.
