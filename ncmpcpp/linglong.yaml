    ncurses-based client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
    ncmpcpp is almost an exact clone of ncmpc which is a text-mode client
    for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. It provides a keyboard oriented and
    consistent interface to MPD and contains some new features ncmpc
    doesn't have. It's been also rewritten from scratch in C++.

    New features include:
    - tag editor;
    - playlists editor;
    - easy to use search screen;
    - media library screen;
    - lyrics screen;
    - possibility of going to any position in currently playing track
    without rewinding/fastforwarding;
    - multi colored main window (if you want);
    - songs can be added to playlist more than once;
    - a lot of minor useful functions.
