    powerful, customizable, Motif based text editor
    NEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for the X Window System, which
    combines a standard, easy to use, graphical user interface with the
    thorough functionality and stability required by users who edit text
    eight hours a day. It provides intensive support for development in
    a wide variety of languages, text processors, and other tools, but
    at the same time can be used productively by just about anyone who
    needs to edit text.

    Because of its mature age, NEdit does not support UTF-8 text files,
    nor will that be implemented.
