    heavily refactored vim fork (runtime files)
    Neovim is a fork of Vim focused on modern code and features, rather than
    running in legacy environments.

    This package contains the architecture independent runtime files used by
    neovim.  Examples of such files are: documentation, rules for
    language-specific highlighting and indentation, color schemes, and standard
    plugins.
