    dungeon crawl game - X11 interface
    NetHack is a wonderfully silly, yet quite addictive, Dungeons &
    Dragons-style adventure game. You play a character from one of many
    classes (such as wizard, ranger, or tourist), fighting your way down to
    retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (try saying THAT one backwards!) for your
    god. On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two, or
    perhaps King Arthur, or - if you're REALLY lucky - the Ravenous
    Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

    You should install a front-end for NetHack if you
    wish to play the game.  Each of them includes the
    original non-graphical version, and they can all be installed
    at the same time:
    - nethack-console: no graphics, just plain NetHack;
    - nethack-x11    : original X11/Athena-based graphical version;
    - nethack-qt     : Qt version.

    This package provides the text and X11/Athena-based graphical versions
    of NetHack.
