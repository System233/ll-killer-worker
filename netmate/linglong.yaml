    netdude clone that shows pcap dump lines in network header style
    netmate was inspired in netdude[1] (dead) and can be used to learn and teach
    about TCP/IP protocols. It is a GTK+ program that shows lines selected from
    files in pcap style (generated by tcpdump and Wireshark or another code based
    in libpcap) as 32-bit headers, identical to the used by RFCs.

    This program works with Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMP6, NDP and
    others.
