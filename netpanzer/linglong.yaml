    online multiplayer tactical warfare game
    netPanzer is an isometric view real-time tactical game designed for
    play across the Internet and over LAN systems. One on one games are
    possible via direct connect or modem.

    netPanzer is designed for FAST ACTION combat -- it is not another resource
    management clone. In fact, there aren't any resources at all. Each player
    will have many units of different types at their disposal. Players can fight
    until their units are destroyed -- then respawn and keep on going.

    The game is real-time, but it's based on quick tactical action and unit
    management. Battles progress quickly and constantly; in fact, they never
    let up. There is no stop in the action because there is no waiting for
    resources to be collected and converted into weaponry. Players can join
    or leave  multiplayer games at any time.
