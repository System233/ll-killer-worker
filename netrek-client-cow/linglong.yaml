    client for netrek online game
    This is a client for the multi-player game of Netrek.

    Netrek is probably the first video game which can accurately be
    described as a "sport".  It has more in common with basketball than
    with arcade games or Quake.  Its vast and expanding array of tactics
    and strategies allows for many different play styles; the best
    players are the ones who think fastest, not necessarily the ones who
    twitch most effectively.  It can be enjoyed as a twitch game, since
    the dogfighting system is extremely robust, but the things that
    really set Netrek apart from other video games are the team and
    strategic aspects.  Team play is dynamic and varied, with roles
    constantly changing as the game state changes.  Strategic play is
    explored in organized league games; after 6+ years of league play,
    strategies are still being invented and refined.

    The game was created in 1988, and still has players, including some
    people who have been playing for nearly as long as the game has
    existed.
