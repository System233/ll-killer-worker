    network management framework (GNOME frontend)
    NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
    and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
    available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
    devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
    services.

    This package contains a systray applet for GNOME's notification area but it
    also works for other desktop environments which provide a systray like KDE
    or Xfce.
    It displays the available networks and allows users to easily switch between
    them. For encrypted networks it will prompt the user for the key/passphrase
    and it can optionally store them in the gnome-keyring.
