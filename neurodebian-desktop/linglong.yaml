    neuroscience-oriented distribution - desktop integration
    The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
    projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
    FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
    pandas, etc.).

    This package provides NeuroDebian artwork (icons, background image)
    and a NeuroDebian menu featuring the most popular neuroscience tools,
    which will be automatically installed upon initial invocation.
