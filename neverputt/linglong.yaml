    3D miniature golf game
    Neverputt is a hot-seat multi-player miniature golf game for 1 to 4 players.
    The 18-hole course takes advantage of all the elements that challenge
    Neverball players, including moving platforms and barriers, teleporters,
    ramps, and drop-offs. A simple putting interface and golf scoring system
    have been added.
