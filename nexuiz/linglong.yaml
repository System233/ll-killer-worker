    Fast-paced 3D first-person shooter
    Nexuiz Classic is a fast-paced 3D deathmatch game with high-end and complex
    graphics effects. It is intended to be played over the Internet or over a
    local network. Several different game types, such as classic deathmatch, team
    deathmatch and capture the flag are available.
    It also supports a single-player mode and playing against the computer.

    The game brings deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon  balancing
    and fast paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of realistic
    shooters.

    This package installs the client to play the game.

    This game was originally released as "Nexuiz", but is now referred to as
    "Nexuiz Classic" since the Nexuiz name was re-used for a non-free game
    for consoles.
