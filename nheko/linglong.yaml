    desktop IM client for the Matrix protocol
    Nheko is a Qt-based chat client for Matrix, an open, federated communications
    protocol.  The motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop
    app for Matrix that feels more like a mainstream chat app and less like an IRC
    client.
