    platform game where your goal is to collect candies
    You play the role of a 9 year old boy in his absolute dream: a world made
    of sweets! Guide Nikwi through his dream to eat everything in each of the 30
    levels, while you avoid the monsters who try to turn Nikwi's dream into a
    nightmare.

    candy themes, more than 10 different monsters and obstacles -each one with
    it's own unique behaviour- and new gameplay elements in every theme.
