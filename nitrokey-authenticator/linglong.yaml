    TOTP authenticator app that's using Nitrokey Pro2 and/or LibremKey
    A TOTP authenticator app similar to Google Authenticator. This app, unlike
    Google Authenticator, does not store TOTP shared secrets on the computer,
    but inside the USB key. The application supports both, Nitrokey Pro2 and
    LibremKey. For the latter, however, you need to have libnitrokey version
    3.6 or newer installed on your system.
