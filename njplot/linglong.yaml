    phylogenetic tree drawing program
    NJplot is able to draw any dendrogram expressed in the Newick standard
    phylogenetic tree format (e.g., the format used by the Phylip package).
    NJplot is especially convenient for rooting the unrooted trees
    obtained from parsimony, distance or maximum likelihood tree-building
    methods.
