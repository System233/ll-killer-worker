    image viewer with capability of syncing multiple instances
    nomacs is a free image viewer for Windows and Linux systems, which is
    licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. nomacs is small, fast and
    able to handle the most common image formats. Additionally it is possible to
    synchronize multiple viewers. A synchronization of viewers running on
    the same computer or via LAN is possible. It allows one to compare images
    and spot the differences (e.g. schemes of architects to show the
    progress).
