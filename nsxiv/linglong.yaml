    neo simple X image viewer
    nsxiv (the Neo Simple X Image Viewer) is a fork of the now-unmaintained
    sxiv project, with the purpose of being a drop-in replacement for sxiv,
    maintaining its interface, and adding simple, sensible features. nsxiv aims
    to be easy to modify and customise, and works nicely with tiling window
    managers.

    Features:

    - Basic image operations, e.g. zooming, panning, rotating
    - Customizable key and mouse button mappings
    - Scriptable via configuration files
    - Thumbnail mode: grid of selectable previews of all images
    - Ability to cache thumbnails for fast re-loading
    - Basic support for animated/multi-frame images (GIF/WebP)
    - Display image information in status bar
    - Display image name/path in X title
