    TOTP Authenticator application
    A Gnome Authenticator clone. This generates 2fa tokens based on secrets
    installed. It registers as uri-handler for otpauth:// urls so they can be
    added from Megapixels.

    Note this app is designed for small screens, and works perfectly on mobile
    phones.
