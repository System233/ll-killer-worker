    crayon based physics puzzle game
    Numpty Physics is a drawing puzzle game in the spirit (and style?) of
    Crayon Physics using the same excellent Box2D engine. It melds cute
    schoolbook-style graphics with a kind of realistic physics engine.

    It includes a built-in editor so that you may build (and submit) your
    own levels.
