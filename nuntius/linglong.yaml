    share notifications from Android phone or tablet via Bluetooth or LAN
    Deliver notifications from your Android phone or tablet to your
    computer using Bluetooth or LAN.  To use, you will need to install a
    companion tool on your phone or tablet and either pair it via
    Bluetooth or point it at an on-screen QR code.

    You may need to restart your session to auto-start nuntius.

    This is similar to KDE Connect (Debian package kdeconnect), albeit
    much less mature, but uses of GNOME infrastructure instead of KDE
    infrastructure, which under some circumstances can result is a
    significantly smaller total footprint.
