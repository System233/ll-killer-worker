    Tool for configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver
    The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA
    Linux graphics driver.  It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA
    X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This
    communication is done with the NV-CONTROL X extension.

    Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature,
    and OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.
