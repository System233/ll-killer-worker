    Document layout analysis and optical character recognition system
    OCRFeeder is a document layout analysis and optical character
    recognition system.

    Given the images it will automatically outline its contents,
    distinguish between what's graphics and text and perform OCR over the
    latter. It generates multiple formats being its main one ODT.

    It features a complete GTK+ graphical user interface that allows the
    users to correct any unrecognized characters, defined or correct
    bounding boxes, set paragraph styles, clean the input images, import
    PDFs, save and load the project, export everything to multiple
    formats, etc.
