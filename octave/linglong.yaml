    GNU Octave language for numerical computations
    Octave is a (mostly MATLABÂ® compatible) high-level language, primarily
    intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line
    interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

    Octave can be dynamically extended with user-supplied C++ files.
