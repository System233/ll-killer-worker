    develop, simulate and run magnetic resonance sequences
    ODIN is a framework for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
    It covers the whole toolchain of MRI, from low-level data acquisition
    to image reconstruction. In particular, it aims at rapid prototyping
    of MRI sequences. The sequences can be programmed using a high-level,
    object oriented, C++ programming interface.  It provides advanced
    sequence analysis tools, such as interactive plotting of k-space
    trajectories, a user interface for a fast compile-link-test cycle
    and a powerful MRI simulator which supports different virtual samples.
    For fast and flexible image reconstruction, ODIN contains a highly
    customizable, multi-threaded data-processing framework.
