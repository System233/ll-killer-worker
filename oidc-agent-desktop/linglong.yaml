    oidc-agent desktop integration
    Desktop integration files for oidc-gen and oidc-agent and for creating the user
    dialog.

    This package adds two ways for supporting the usage of oidc-agent in a
    graphical environment.
    The .desktop file to leverage browser integration to support the authorization
    code flow in oidc-gen.
    The Xsession file to consistently set the environment variables necessary to
    for client tools to connect to the oidc-agent daemon.

    This package also provides a bash script as an interface to create different
    dialog windows. It uses yad to create windows.
