    hexadecimal editor for binary files
    Okteta is a simple editor for the raw data of files. This type of program is
    also called hexadecimal editor or binary editor.

    The data is displayed in two variants: as the numeric values of the bytes
    and as the character assigned to the values. Values and characters can be
    shown either in two columns (the traditional display in hex editors) or in
    rows with the value on top of the character. Editing can be done both for
    the values and for the characters.

    Besides the usual editing capabilities Okteta also brings a small set of
    tools, like a table listing decodings into common simple data types, a table
    listing all possible bytes with their character and value equivalents, an
    info view with a statistic, a checksum calculator, a filter tool and a string
    extraction tool.
