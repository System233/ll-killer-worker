    text-based roguelike game
    Omega is a complex rogue-style game of dungeon exploration. Unlike other such
    games, there are a number of ways to "win", depending on various actions
    taken during play. The ways you can get your name on the high score board
    include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild, sect, college, etc., as
    well as gaining the most points figured from possessions and experience. The
    game (via the oracle) may impose some structure on your exploration, but you
    need not follow all of the oracle's advice. There *is* a "total winner"
    status, by the way.
