    cat chases the cursor (now a mouse) around the screen
    A cat (neko) chases the cursor (now a mouse) around the screen while
    you work.  Alternatively, a dog chases a bone. There are menu options
    for starting and stopping the program easily on cat and dog modes.
    Other variations and detailed configurations are available through
    command line options.
