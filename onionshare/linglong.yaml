    Share a file over Tor Hidden Services anonymously and securely
    OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size with
    someone. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor
    hidden service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download
    the file. It doesn't require setting up a server on the Internet somewhere
    or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own
    computer and use a Tor hidden service to make it temporarily accessible
    over the Internet. The other user just needs to use the Tor Browser and
    TO Enter the URL to download the file from you.
