    colossal cave adventure, the 1995 430-point version
    This is the last descendent of the original 1976 Colossal Cave
    Adventure worked on by the original authors -- Crowther & Woods.
    It has sometimes been known as Adventure 2.5. The original PDP-10
    name 'advent' is used for the built program to avoid collision with
    the BSD Games version.
