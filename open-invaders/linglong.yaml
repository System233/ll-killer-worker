    Space Invaders clone
    Space Invaders is one of the earliest arcade shoot 'em up games.
    The player can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen
    and must shoot at an incoming wave of aliens before they reach
    the bottom.

    Open Invaders is a clone of the legendary 70's classic, but with
    completely new graphics, several bonus levels, etc.
