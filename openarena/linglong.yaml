    OpenArena is an open-source content package for ioQuake3 licensed under the
    GPL, effectively creating a free stand-alone game. Though OpenArena is a free
    replacement for id Software Inc.'s Quake 3 Arena, it is NOT compatible with
    the proprietary game!

    OpenArena might be considered unsuitable for children.

    This package installs the OpenArena client.
