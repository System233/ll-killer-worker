    LXDE session manager and configuration files
    LXDE (the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a project aimed
    to provide a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast.

    It's not designed to be powerful and bloated, but to be usable and slim
    enough, and keep the resource usage low. Different from other desktop
    environments, LXDE doesn't tightly integrate every component. Instead,
    LXDE tries to make all components independent, and each of them can be
    used independently with fewer dependencies.

    Features:

    * Lightweight, runs with reasonable memory usage
    * Fast, runs well even on older machines produced in 1999
    * Good-looking, GTK+ 2 internationalized user interface
    * Easy-to-use, the user interface is simple, but usable enough
    * Desktop independent (surprise! Every component can be used without LXDE)
    * Standard compliant, follows the specs on freedesktop.org

    This package depends on minimal set of components (lxsession, openbox,
    and lxde-screenlock.desktop file), and contains all the session-specific
    configuration files required to start a LXDE desktop session from a
    display manager such as GDM.
