    3D city simulator game
    OpenCity is 3D city construction simulator. You can build some zones of
    housing, trading and industry, electric plant and roads. Besides you can also
    raise or lower the terrain.
    OpenCity is similar in spirit to other city construction games, heading
    towards a classic SimCity feeling, although with some additional features.
    It is not intended to be a clone of any famous city simulator.
