    Jazz Jackrabbit™ game engine reimplementation
    OpenJazz is a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit™ games.

    Jazz Jackrabbit™ is a PC platform game. Produced by Epic Games (then Epic
    MegaGames), it was first released in 1994. The fast-paced, colourful gameplay
    proved popular, and the game won PC Format's Arcade Game of the Year award.
    Many people still fondly recall the shareware versions.

    With the demise of DOS-based operating systems, it has become necessary to use
    emulators to play old DOS games. Jazz Jackrabbit™ deserves more - and would
    benefit greatly from new features.

    To play, you will need the files from one of the original games. Current
    releases of `game-data-packager' are able to generate a suitable data package
    from the Jazz Jackrabbit Collection as published on GOG.
