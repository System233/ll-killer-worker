    Structured Storage Explorer
    OpenMCDF is a 100% managed CLI component that allows client applications to
    manipulate COM structured storage files, also known as Microsoft Compound
    Document Format files.

    This file format is used under the hood by a lot of applications: the files
    created by Microsoft Office until the 2007 product release are all structured
    storage files. They include multiple streams of information (document summary,
    user data) in a single physical container (the file). Also the omnipresent
    Thumbs.db, used by Windows as thumbnails cache, is a structured storage file.

    OpenMCDF makes available to the developer an easy interface to read, write, add
    and remove structured storage primitives. Structured storage items are
    organized in a hierarchical tree where 'storage' nodes act like a directory and
    'stream' nodes like a file. Developers can use OpenMCDF to view storages and
    streams, traverse hierarchical trees of items, explore existing compound file
    and modify them or create a new compound file from scratch.
