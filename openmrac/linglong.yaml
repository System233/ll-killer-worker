    split-screen multiplayer 3D racing game
    OpenMRac is an open-source release of FranticWare's MultiRacer. It is a
    multiplayer racing game that runs on Linux and Microsoft Windows.

    It can be played in single player mode, running against oneself's "ghost" from
    previous lap, or in multi-player mode, in a vertical split screen against up
    to 3 other opponents.

    OpenMRac is simpler than TORCS, although it offers better model reflections
    than the latter.
