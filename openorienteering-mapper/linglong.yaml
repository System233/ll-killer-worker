    Orienteering map drawing application
    OpenOrienteering Mapper is an application to draw maps for forest,
    sprint, MTB and radio orienteering races. It comes with predefined
    symbol sets implementing the IOF standards ISOM (1:15000, 1:10000)
    and ISSOM (1:5000, 1:4000). It is easy to implement additional symbol
    sets.

    It provides a Free alternative to existing proprietary map drawing
    applications and supports multiple platforms. It is available for
    Android, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

    While it is under continuous development and considered in beta
    state, it has been used to produce maps for orienteering races. All
    required functions for drawing maps are implemented and the program
    works very stable. So it can be considered ready for productive use,
    although it is like always a good idea to keep backups of your files.
