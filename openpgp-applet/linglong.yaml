    GNOME applet for OpenPGP text encryption
    OpenPGP Applet is a graphical frontend on top of GnuPG.

    It allows encryption and decryption of the clipboard's content either
    with public key cryptography, or with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.
    Creating and verifying clear text signatures is also supported.

    Note: OpenPGP Applet does not handle passphrase input. Since it also does not
    offer terminal interaction unless explicitly run from there, it relies in
    practice on GnuPG agent to be running and configured to use a passphrase entry
    dialog, such as pinentry-gnome3.
