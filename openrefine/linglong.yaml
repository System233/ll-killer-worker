    powerful tool for working with messy data
    OpenRefine is a power tool for working with messy data. Use it to improve data
    consistency, link it to data registries like Wikidata, augment it with data
    from other sources, transform it into different formats for other tools to
    consume, and contribute it back to the original sources. OpenRefine is not a
    web service but a desktop app that runs on your own computer, so you can
    process sensitive data with privacy.
