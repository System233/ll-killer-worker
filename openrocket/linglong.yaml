    Model Rocket Simulator
    OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows
    you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and
    flying them.

    OpenRocket features a full six-degree-of-freedom simulation, realistic
    wind modeling, a multitude of different components including free-form
    and canted fins, clustering and staging.

    This package therefore downloads the pre-built OpenRocket .jar file from
    the upstream site and installs it.
