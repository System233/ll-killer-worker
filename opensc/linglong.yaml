    Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
    OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
    cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
    operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
    mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
    implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
    Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
    standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
    well.

    Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
    https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki - only some cards are
    supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
    card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
    operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
    require third party proprietary software.

    This package contains tools for interacting with smart cards.
