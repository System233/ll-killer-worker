    Control application for Blackmagic Design ATEM video switchers
    Open Switcher is a control application for the Blackmagic Design ATEM video
    switchers. These are normally controlled with the propriatary Windows or Osx
    application over a network connection. In some cases it's also possible to
    control these switchers using hardware buttons but that doesn't expose the full
    functionality of these mixers.

    Switcher Control is a re-implementation that aims to be as close to the
    supported features of ATEM Software Control as possible. Getting to 100%
    compatibility would be quite hard since it exposes quite a lot of extra
    functionalities for specific models of mixers which would be technically
    difficult to implement or hard to do due to lack of access to the more
    expensive hardware.

    This is the GTK+3 control application package.
