    Virtual lens/mirror design workshop
    OpticalRayTracer is an application that analyzes systems of lenses and mirrors.
    It uses optical principles and a virtual optical bench to predict the behavior
    of many kinds of ordinary and exotic lens types as well as flat and curved
    mirrors. OpticalRayTracer includes an advanced, easy-to-use interface that
    allows the user to rearrange the optical configuration by dragging objects
    around using the mouse.

    OpticalRayTracer fully analyzes lens optical properties, including refraction
    and dispersion. The dispersion display uses color-coded light beams to simplify
    interpretation of the results.

    OpticalRayTracer allows the creation of mirrors, flat and curved. In modern
    optical designs, mirrors often produce better results than lenses, for example
    in astronomical instruments. Such instruments can be roughed out in
    OpticalRayTracer's virtual workbench.
