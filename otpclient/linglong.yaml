    Simple GTK+ software to generate OTPs (TOTP and HOTP)
    OTPClient is GTK+ software for two-factor authentication
    that supports both Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP)
    and HMAC-Based One-Time Passwords (HOTP).

    Features:
    - Support both TOTP and HOTP.
    - Support setting custom digits (between 4 and 10 inclusive).
    - Support setting a custom period (between 10 and 120 seconds inclusive).
    - Support SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 algorithms.
    - Support for Steam codes.
    - Import encrypted Authenticator Plus backup.
    - Import and export encrypted and/or plain andOTP backup.
    - Import and export plain FreeOTPPlus backup (key URI format only).
    - Import and export plain Aegis backup (plain json only).
    - Local database is encrypted using AES256-GCM.
    * Key is derived using PBKDF2 with SHA512 and 100k iterations.
    * Decrypted file is never saved (and hopefully never swapped) to disk.
    While the app is running, the decrypted content resides
    in a "secure memory" buffer allocated by Gcrypt.
