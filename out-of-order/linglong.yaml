    comedy science fiction adventure game
    Ever woken up in the middle of the night to find you've been kidnapped...
    and so's your bedroom? Ever had to fend for yourself in the face of
    strangely hypnotic music, alien doctors, talking computers a-plenty and
    half-finished bathrooms? Ever found something unpleasant in a burger?

    If so, Out Of Order should play like any other day in your life.

    Otherwise, it's an experience not to be missed.
