    bi-directional scrolling arcade game
    Overgod is an arcade game with bi-directional scrolling where you need to
    destroy all enemies in an area in a given time. The game is a mix of the
    classic arcade games Asteroids and Thrust with a lot of additional features.

    Overgod can also be played in two-player duel or cooperative modes, or in
    a special "Time Attack" version where enemies endlessly appear.
