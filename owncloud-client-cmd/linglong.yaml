    folder synchronization with an ownCloud server - cmd client
    The ownCloudSync system lets you always have your latest files wherever
    you are. Just specify one or more folders on the local machine to and a server
    to synchronize to. You can configure more computers to synchronize to the same
    server and any change to the files on one computer will silently and reliably
    flow across to every other.

    This package provides the command line client specialising in
    synchronizing with cloud storage provided by ownCloud.
