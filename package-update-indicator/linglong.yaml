    Notify about available software updates
    This small utility which regularly checks for software updates and notifies
    the user about available updates using desktop notifications and either
    a status notifier icon or a system tray icon.

    It is primarily intended for desktops which do not already have this
    functionality built-in, such as Xfce.
