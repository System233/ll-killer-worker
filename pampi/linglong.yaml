    Presentations with Markdown, Pandoc, Impress.
    PAMPI is a free software to create presentations easily.

    presentations are written in text files,
    - so they can be modified easily
    - the files syntax (Markdown) is easily learnt
    - many examples of usable Markdown are available at
    https://enacit1.epfl.ch/markdown-pandoc
    They are converted to web pages (HTML files)
    - one can view them with a browser
    - one can publish them online, grab them on a USB stick, etc.
    In PAMPI's interface, the Markdown file is displaied in the left
    side and on can view the result in the right side.

    Every step of a presentation can be located in any position in a 3D
    space
    - one provides its coordinates
    - one can specify its zoom factor
    - one can specify rotations
    Maths can be authored with KaTeX.

    Here are many examples: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics.
