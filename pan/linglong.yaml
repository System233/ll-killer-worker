    newsreader based on GTK3, which looks like Forte Agent
    Pan is a newsreader, loosely based on Agent and Gravity, which attempts to be
    pleasant to use for new and advanced users alike. It has all the typical
    features found in newsreaders and also supports offline newsreading,
    sophisticated filtering, multiple connections, and a number of extra features
    for power users and alt.binaries fans.
