    action game that involves popping balloons with a harpoon
    Pang Zero is a clone and enhancement of Super Pang, a fast-paced action
    game that involves popping balloons with a harpoon.

    The intention is to create a fun, open-source game that many (currently
    up to 6) people can play together. You can play Pang Zero alone, but it's
    a lot more fun to play with your friends.
