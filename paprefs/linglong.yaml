    PulseAudio Preferences
    PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
    WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
    much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.

    PulseAudio Preferences (paprefs) is a simple GTK+ based configuration dialog
    for the PulseAudio sound server.
