    Parallel Visualization Application
    ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform application designed to
    visualize data sets of size varying from small to very large. The
    goals of the ParaView project include the following:

    * Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization application.
    * Support distributed computation models to process large data sets.
    * Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.
    * Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards.

    ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as
    single processor systems and has been successfully tested on Windows,
    Mac OS X, Linux and various Unix workstations, clusters and
    supercomputers. Under the hood, ParaView uses the Visualization
    Toolkit as the data processing and rendering engine and has a user
    interface written using Qt.
