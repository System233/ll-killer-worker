    Simple & Secure Password Management
    Password Safe allows you to safely and easily create a secured and
    encrypted user name/password list. With Password Safe all you have to do
    is create and remember a single "Master Password" of your choice in order
    to unlock and access your entire user name/password list.

    This is the GNU/Linux version of the popular PasswordSafe password
    manager, originally designed by the renowned security technologist
    Bruce Schneier and open sourced in 2002.

    Compatible with 1.x, 2.x and 3.x versions of the database format.
