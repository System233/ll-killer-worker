    PulseAudio controller for the system tray
    Pasystray enables control of various PulseAudio server settings from the X11
    system tray. It can:
    * adjust the volume of streams and sinks/sources
    * transfer streams between sinks/sources
    * switch the default sink/source
    * set the default server (PULSE_SERVER)
    * detect network PulseAudio services
    * rename devices

    The commands associated with the suggested dependencies (paman, paprefs,
    pavucontrol, and pavumeter) may be launched from the menu provided by
    pasystray. If a command is not available, that particular menu item is
    disabled. pulseaudio-module-zeroconf enables detection and management of
    network PulseAudio services.
