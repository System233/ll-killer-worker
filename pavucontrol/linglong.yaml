    PulseAudio Volume Control
    PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK+ based volume
    control tool (mixer) for the PulseAudio sound server. In contrast to
    classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume of
    hardware devices and of each playback stream separately. It also allows
    you to redirect a playback stream to another output device without
    interrupting playback.
