    track menstrual cycles and predict fertility periods
    Periodic Calendar is a GUI application which assists in women menstrual
    cycles tracking and fertility periods prediction. This information can
    be used as supportive either for conception or contraception planning.

    Periodic Calendar provides support for BBT and sympto-thermal methods
    which have the highest reliability in fertility periods prediction. User
    can choose any subset of the features to be used or even fall to the generic
    calendar method (which if used alone is very unreliable).

    Authors of the Periodic Calendar still insist on not being an equal
    substitute to the fertility planning consultants or doctors. Before
    using this application please talk to your doctor or read a good book
    on the subject.

    THE PREDICTIONS MADE BY THIS PROGRAM CAN BE NEVER BE CONSIDERED AS FINAL. THE
    METHODS USED ARE NOT 100% EFFECTIVE FOR ALL WOMEN.
