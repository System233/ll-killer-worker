    Visualisation tools for the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit
    The PCP GUI package primarily includes visualisation tools for
    monitoring systems using live and archived Performance Co-Pilot
    (PCP) sources.

    These tools have dependencies on graphics libraries which may or
    may not be installed on server machines, so PCP GUI is delivered
    as a separate package to the core PCP infrastructure.
