    multi-monitor presentation tool (ala Keynote) for PDF files
    PPC is a viewer for PDF which uses Keynote-like multi-monitor output
    to provide meta information to the speaker.  It can show a normal
    presentation window on one screen and a more sophisticated overview
    on the other, with information like a picture of the next slide and a
    clock with the time remaining.
