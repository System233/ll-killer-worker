    peg elimination solitaire game
    Peg-E is a peg solitaire game in which you jump over pieces in order to
    remove them from the board, ultimately trying to eliminate all but one.
    The boards are randomly generated, with 100 levels of difficulty. The game
    auto-saves, and has undo-redo capability. Pieces can move horizontally,
    vertically, and diagonally.
