    2D Oldschool platform game where you control a rooster
    Your mission in Pekka Kana 2 is to save Pekka's chicken friends
    from an evil crow.

    The simple goal in each level is to find the exit sign, which is usually
    not that simple as it sounds because of enemies, traps, and quirky puzzles.
