    Pentobi is a strategy board game played on a square grid board using playing
    pieces in the shapes of polyominoes, similar to Tetris pieces.  The aim of the
    game is to place all of your pieces while trying to block your opponent from
    placing all of theirs.

    The game ends when no one can place any more pieces and the winner is
    determined by calculating the score based on the points of any remaining
    playing pieces. Bonus points are added for playing every piece and additional
    bonus points are added if the monomino, the 1x1 square piece, is played last.
