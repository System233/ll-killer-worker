    Graphical design of primers for PCR
    PerlPrimer is a free, open-source GUI application written in Perl that designs
    primers for standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), bisulphite PCR,
    real-time PCR (QPCR) and sequencing. It aims to automate and simplify the
    process of primer design.

    If operated online, the tool nicely communicates with the Ensembl
    project for further insights into the gene structure, i.e., allowing
    for taking the location of exons and introns into account for the design
    of the primers.  The sequences themselves can be retrieved, too.
