    GUI for uncertainty treatment and variabilities management
    Persalys is a graphical user interface for OpenTURNS, dedicated to the
    treatment of uncertainty and the management of variabilities. The software is
    a tool between the computer simulation, probabilistic analyses and the data
    sciences. The interface is available in French or in English.

    Persalys allows one to:
    - create mathematical models: analytical, coupling with an external model
    (finite elements, ...), FMU;
    - analyse the variability of one's parameters thanks to many methods and
    visualisation tools;
    - statistically analyse one's measuring data, infer probability distributions
    or create metamodels.
