    comic book reader
    Peruse was created as a way to make exactly that as easy and pleasant
    as possible, and to simply get out of the way and let you read your
    comic books.  One could say that it allows you to peruse your comic
    books at your leisure, but that would be a silly way of putting it -
    so, peruse your comic books at your leisure!
