    PostgreSQL graphical client using Tcl/Tk
    Postgres Forms (pfm) is a client application with a graphical user
    interface for the PostgreSQL data base server. It enables the user:
    to design forms for adding, modifying or deleting records of data
    base tables;

    - to design links (one to many relationships) from one form
    to another, for navigating in the data base;

    - to design and to generate reports based on the data in a
    table or view;

    - to edit and to execute SQL statements.

    Postgres Forms is implemented in Tcl/Tk, but there is no need for the
    user to program anything in Tcl/Tk. The user only has to use SQL for
    creating tables and views and for designing forms, links and reports.

    Postgres Forms makes no attempt to hide the underlying SQL. On the
    contrary, in most cases, it shows both the SQL statements it sends to
    the PostgreSQL server and the results it gets back.

    The PostgreSQL server can be remote or local.
