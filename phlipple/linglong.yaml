    reduce 3D shapes to a single square
    Phlipple is a unique puzzle game. The goal of every level is to reduce
    a 3D shape to a single square. Elimination of squares is done by flipping
    edges around just like in a cardboard box. It starts off relatively easy
    to teach the basics just to later on serve hours of brain tickling fun.
    It's a great way to train memory as well as orientation in 3D.
