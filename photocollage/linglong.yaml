    Graphical tool to make photo collage posters
    PhotoCollage allows you to create photo collage posters. It assembles
    the input photographs it is given to generate a big poster. Photos are
    automatically arranged to fill the whole poster, then you can change the
    final layout, dimensions, border or swap photos in the generated grid.
    Eventually the final poster image can be saved in any size.
