    web-based SQLite database admin tool
    phpLiteAdmin is a web-based SQLite database admin tool written in PHP with
    support for SQLite3 and SQLite2 (not in Debian). Following in the spirit of the
    flat-file system used by SQLite, phpLiteAdmin consists of a single source file,
    phpliteadmin.php, that is dropped into a directory on a server and then visited
    in a browser. The available operations, feature set, interface, and user
    experience is comparable to that of phpMyAdmin.

    In this package, you will find phpliteadmin.php already configured to work with
    Apache2. This package provides the main features of the script.
