    Learn the piano just by playing a game
    A MIDI file player/game that displays the musical notes AND teaches you how
    to play the piano.

    PianoBooster is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and
    at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation.
    The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard MIDI file
    is that PianoBooster listens and reacts to what you are playing on a
    MIDI keyboard.

    To run Piano Booster you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI interface
    for the PC. If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out
    PianoBooster, using the PC keyboard ('x' is middle C), but a MIDI piano
    is really recommended.
