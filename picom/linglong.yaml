    lightweight compositor for X11
    picom is a compositor for X11, based on xcompmgr. In addition to shadows,
    fading and translucency, picom implements window frame opacity control,
    inactive window transparency, and shadows on argb windows.

    picom is a fork of compton as it seems to have become unmaintained.
