    Graphical application for photography planning
    Calculates and displays the positions of the Sun, Moon and Milky Way
    for any time and location on the earth.

    This tool is useful for photography planning as
    it gives information on when these celestial bodies rise and set,
    as well as where in the sky they should be visible
    in terms of azimuth and elevation.
