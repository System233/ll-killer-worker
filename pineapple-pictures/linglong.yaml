    Lightweight Qt5 image viewer
    An uncluttered and fast image viewer which is very simple and easy to
    use. There is also an option to make the window stay on top so users
    can also pin the window with their image as a reference image window
    and work with other software they want. This software will always keep
    the image file as-is, will never accidentally modify the original
    image file when you just simply rotated the image and etc.

    Key features:
    - Minimized UI
    - Fast
    - Easy to use
    - High quality scaling
    - Never modify the original image file
    - Stay-on-top option available for pinning reference image
    and work with other applications
