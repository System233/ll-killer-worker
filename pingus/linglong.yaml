    Free Lemmings(TM) clone
    Pingus is a free clone of the popular Lemmings game.

    Your goal is to guide a horde of penguins through a world full of obstacles
    and penguin traps to safety. Although penguins (unlike lemmings) are rather
    smart, they sometimes lack the necessary overview and now rely on you to
    save them.

    This package contains the main program.
