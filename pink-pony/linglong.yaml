    3D racing game with ponies
    Pink Pony is a Tron­-like multiplayer racing­ game. You control little
    ponies that leave a trail of flowers everywhere they step. You have to
    evade these trails and force other ponies into them. The last pony standing
    wins the game.

    OpenGL 2.0 is needed for Pink Pony to work.
