    connect pipes to get the water flowing from inlet to outlet
    If you know the old arcade-game "Pipe Dreams", you'll instantly recognize
    this. The goal is to connect different pipe segments to let the water flow
    from the inlet and through as many pipes as possible, until it finally
    reaches the outlet. This requires an even combination of speed, skill and
    foresight.
