    Mobile oriented web comics reader client
    Piperka is a web comic tracking and bookmarking service with over
    5000 comics listed on it.  It doesn't host any web comics by itself
    but maintains a list of them and an index of their archive pages.

    Piperka Client uses Piperka's database to provide browsing and
    navigation for web comics' archives in a unified manner with an
    embedded browser. It stores user's bookmarks and periodically
    contacts the server to check for any updates to the comics that a
    user reads.

    This program is geared towards mobile use.
