    Pandora Radio client for the GNOME desktop
    Pithos is a cross-platform desktop client for the personalized web
    radio Pandora, supporting all important features the official Flashâ„¢
    client has.

    Pithos was based on pianobar, a console client for Pandora. In addition
    to sporting a GTK+ GUI, Pithos has feature-parity with pianobar.

    Out of concern for the longevity of Pandora Media Inc., the
    software authors would recommend subscribing to Pandora One.

    Use of this application requires a Pandora account; one can be created
    for free at https://pandora.com.
