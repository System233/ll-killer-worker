    non-linear audio/video editor using GStreamer
    GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
    which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
    anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
    about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
    that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
    installing new plug-ins.

    PiTiVi allows users to easily edit audio/video projects based on the
    GStreamer framework.  PiTIVi provides several ways of creating and
    modifying a timeline.  Ranging from a simple synopsis view (a-la
    iMovie) to the full-blown editing view (aka Complex View) which puts
    you in complete control of your editing.
