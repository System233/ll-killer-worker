    create posters and banners from multiple glued-together pages
    This program is for situations when you want to create a large poster or
    banner but do not have a printer that supports large sheets of paper. Plakativ
    allows one to enlarge and split a PDF across multiple pages, creating another
    PDF with pages of the desired printable size. After printing, the pages can be
    glued together to form a larger poster. Features:

    - lossless operation
    - no pixel artifacts when upscaling if PDF contains vector graphics
    - GUI with preview functionality
    - complex layouter to save paper
    - optimize by number of pages, output poster size or multiple of input area

    This package contains the executable.
