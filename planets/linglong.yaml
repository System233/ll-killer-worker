    Gravitation simulation of planetary bodies
    Planets is a simple interactive program for playing with simulations
    of planetary systems. It is great for teaching gravitation on planet
    level.

    The user interface is aimed at being simple enough for a fairly young
    kid to enjoy it, there is a special kid-mode for this purpose.
