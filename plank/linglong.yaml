    Elegant, simple, clean dock
    Plank is a dock enabling you to start applications and manage your windows.

    Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet. The goal is to
    provide just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more. It is,
    however, a library which can be extended to create other dock programs
    with more advanced features.
