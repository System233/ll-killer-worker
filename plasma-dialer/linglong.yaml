    Dialer for Plasma Mobile
    This application aims at enabling voice calls features inside
    a Plasma Mobile environment.

    It is based on Qt graphical libraries and relies on some KDE
    Frameworks. It depends on ModemManager in order to interface
    with the radio device, and on Callaudio to manage audio
    profiles during voice calls.
