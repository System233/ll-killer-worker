    Discover is a graphical software manager for the Plasma workspace.
    It helps users easily and quickly find applications and other software
    they might want to install.

    By allowing to navigate a software library by search, categories, top lists
    along with detailed application information that includes screenshots
    and reviews, users can more quickly find applications that suit their needs.

    Discover will also keep the system up to date by notifying about updates and
    installing them.
