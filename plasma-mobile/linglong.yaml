    Open-source user interface for phones, based on Plasma technologies
    Plasma Mobile is an open-source user interface and ecosystem targeted at
    mobile devices, built on the KDE Plasma stack.

    A pragmatic approach is taken that is inclusive to software regardless of
    toolkit, giving users the power to choose whichever software they want to
    use on their device.

    Plasma Mobile aims to contribute to and implement open standards, and is
    developed in a transparent process that is open for anyone to participate in.
