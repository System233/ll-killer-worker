    Settings application for Plasma Mobile
    This package contains configuration modules for the Plasma mobile
    environment, allowing the user to modify in a graphical interface, various
    configurations related to audio, Bluetooth, monitor, default applications,
    virtual keyboard, notifications, time and date, localization, network modem,
    and other components of the Plasma environment.

    It is based on Qt graphical libraries and KDE Frameworks. In particular,
    it relies on Kirigami so its user interface can fit a variety of display
    sizes. However, it has been optimized for touch devices, so desktop users
    should install the 'systemsettings' package instead.
