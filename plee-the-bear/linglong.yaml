    2D platform game
    Plee the Bear will be a 2D platform game like those found on consoles in
    the beginning of the 90's. The basis of the scenario fit in few lines:

    4 PM or so, Plee wakes up, tired. He has dreamed again about that awesome
    period when he went across the entire world together with his belle. He puts
    his leg in the honey pot... empty! Moreover every single honey pot in the
    house is empty. "One more trick of that kid", he thinks. "I'm going to give
    him such a wallop of which he sure will remember".

    Following honey drops on the ground, Plee reaches the edge of the forest.
    Beginning of the game.

    The current version is a demo.
