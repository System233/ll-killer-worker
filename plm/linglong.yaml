    Programming exerciser in Java, Python, Scala and others
    The Programmer's Learning Machine (PLM) is a free cross-platform programming
    exerciser. It lets you explore various concepts of programming through
    over 200 interactive exercises, that you can solve in either Java,
    Python or Scala.

    The PLM interface and content is thoughtfully translated to English,
    French and Brazilian; Other translations may be added in the future.

    The following concepts are included in this package:

    - Welcome: teach basics of programming to absolute beginners
    - Maze: classical maze escaping algorithms for intermediate
    - Sort: classical sorting algorithms for intermediate. One
    introduction lesson presents the basics of the sorting algorithms
    while two additional lessons apply them in more recreative settings.
    - Recursion: classical logo algorithms for intermediate
    - Turtle Art: explore a few classical LOGO figures
    - LightBot: little programmer's brain teaser for intermediate and advanced

    Other lessons are planned to explore new concepts, such as the
    backtracking, dynamic programming, object-oriented programming or the
    standard libraries of Python, Scala and Java. Other programming languages
    (such as Ruby or JavaScript) may be added in the future.
