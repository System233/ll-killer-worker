    free stenography engine and typing tool
    Plover is a small, slick Python application that runs in the
    background and acts as a translator to read steno movements and
    emulate keystrokes in a way that the programs you are using can't
    even tell you're using steno.

    Plover is used today by hundreds of people, ranging from professional
    stenographers, transcriptionists, programmers, and hobbyists.  It
    supports:

    - Regular keyboards and real steno machines
    - Media key support to control media, change volume, etc.
    - Comes with a well-developed theory extended from StenEd,
    but with over 50,000 new strokes.
    - Supports JSON and RTF/CRE dictionaries
    - Includes training tools to help you learn
