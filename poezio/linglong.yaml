    Console-based XMPP client
    Poezio is a free console XMPP client (the protocol on which the Jabber IM
    network is built).

    Its goal is to let you connect very easily (no account creation needed) to the
    network and join various chatrooms, immediately. It tries to look like the most
    famous IRC clients (weechat, irssi, etc). Many commands are identical and
    you won't be lost if you already know these clients. Configuration can be made
    in a configuration file or directly from the client.
command:
- /opt/apps/poezio.linyaps/files/entrypoint.sh
base: org.deepin.base/23.1.0
build: build-aux/setup.sh
