    SELinux core policy utilities (graphical utilities)
    Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
    of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
    mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
    kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
    improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
    architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
    of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
    based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access Control,
    and Multi-level Security.

    This package contains the system-config-selinux and the selinux-polgengui
    utilities.
