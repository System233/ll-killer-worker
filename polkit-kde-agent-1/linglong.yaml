    KDE dialogs for PolicyKit
    PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
    that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.

    It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
    granting access to privileged operations (like calling the HAL Mount() method)
    for unprivileged (desktop) applications.

    PolicyKit-Kde provides a D-Bus session bus service that is used to
    bring up authentication dialogs used for obtaining privileges.
