    cross-platform SoundFont editor
    Polyphone is an open-source soundfont editor, available for platforms
    supported by Qt5 (GNU/Linux, MacOS X, Windows). It can be used to
    create musical instruments by putting together a multitude of audio
    samples and configure them appropriately, which can then be used by
    synthesisers such as FluidSynth (also in MuseScore) and Timidity and
    played using a MIDI keyboard or other instrument. Polyphone provides
    a simple, efficient and portable interface for creating and editing
    soundfonts in various formats, and tools to facilitate and automate
    the setting of different parameters, making it possible to handle a
    large amount of data. It is available in several languages.

    Features include:
    - import from SF2, SF3, SFZ and sfArk file formats
    - export to SF2, SF3, SFZ file formats
    - support of SF2 format v2.01 and v2.04 (with 24-bit samples)
