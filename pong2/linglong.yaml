    Remake of old arcade classic in OpenGL
    Pong2 is an up till now two player (networked) game inspired
    by the classical "Pong" from Amiga, which adds another
    dimension to the playing field. It makes use of features found
    on modern 3d graphics cards, so decent hardware is a requirement.

    It also has multiplayer support! 2 players can play against
    each other via network.
