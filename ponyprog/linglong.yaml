    Serial device programmer
    PonyProg is a serial device programmer software with a user friendly
    GUI framework available for Windows and Linux. It's purpose is reading
    and writing every serial device. With PonyProg and SI-Prog you can
    program Wafercard for SAT, eeprom within GSM, TV or CAR-RADIO.
    Furthermore it can be used as a low cost starter kit for PIC and AVR.

    Ponyprog supports AVR, SPI eeprom, AVR micro, 12C bus 8bit eeprom, PIC
    16 micro, PIC 12 micro, AT89S micro and SDE2506 eeprom family chips.

    You can open any HEX, e2p, mot, csm, rom, eep, bin files and burn them
    to uC or PIC. You can even backup the old program on the chip using
    Ponyprog. Ponyprog enables the user to write, verify and erase data on
    the microchip.

    Also setting fuse bits and locks using Ponyprog is possible. You can
    save any HEX file to BIN file or eep file, BIN file to HEX file or MOT
    file and vice versa so you can use Ponyprog as converter too. Ponyprog
    offers serial or parallel port programming for uC's. You can even change
    polarity of control lines without touching the wires using I/O port setup.

    Using Ponyprog together with generic USB2serial adapters is currently
    not possible! There are plans on upstream to use libusb to add such
    functionality.
