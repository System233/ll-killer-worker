    splits an image across multiple pages for assembly into a poster
    The PosteRazor splits an image to form a multi-page PDF document. When
    printed, the sheets can be arranged to form a large poster of the original
    picture. An easy to use (wizard like) user interface guides through 5 simple
    steps.

    It relies upon libfreeimage and libxpm supporting many input file formats
    such as BMP, GIF, ICO, JPG, PNG, TIFF, XPM among others handled by FreeImage
    like DDS, Dr. Halo, IFF, JBIG, JPEG/JIF, KOALA, LBM, Kodak PhotoCD, PCX, PBM,
    PGM, PPM, PhotoShop PSD, Sun RAS, TARGA, WBMP, XBM, etc...

    Also, PosteRazor can handle the following image color types: Monochrome,
    Grayscale, 4 Bit palette, 8 Bit palette, 24 Bit RGB, 48 Bit RGB (only via
    TIFF and PNG), 32 Bit CMYK (only via TIFF). 32 Bit RGBA images can be loaded,
    but are transformed to 24 Bit RGB by "merging" them with a white background.

    It supports dimension units like m, mm, cm, inch, ft, pt(72th inch) and it
    prints the PDF output file in A4, A3, Legal, Letter or Tabloid layout.
