    Graphical dungeon crawling game
    This is a roguelike originally developed specifically for the Gameboy
    Advance (GBA). It is not a port of an existing roguelike as the controls
    of the GBA are very different from the traditional keyboard, and the screen
    imposes some additional limitations. It is built around replayability and
    long term ergonomics, not short term learning. It uses actual graphic tiles
    (16x16) rather than the traditional characters.
