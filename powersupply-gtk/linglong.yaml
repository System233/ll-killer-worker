    Graphical power status tool for Linux mobile devices
    Powersupply is a simple GTK+3 application monitoring the status of power
    supply nodes, exposing the current battery and USB power status through
    a simple UI.

    This application is aimed primarily at mobile devices (such as phones
    and tablets) running Linux, but it should work on laptops as well.
