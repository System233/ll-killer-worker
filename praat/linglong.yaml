  description: |-
    program for speech analysis and synthesis
    According to its authors, praat is "doing phonetics by computer".  Through
    its graphical interface, several speech analysis functionalities are
    available: spectrograms, cochleograms, and pitch and formant
    extraction.  Articulatory synthesis, as well as synthesis from pitch,
    formant, and intensity are also available.  Other features are
    segmentation, labelling using the phonetic alphabet, and computation of
    statistics.  Praat is configurable and extensible through its own scripting
    language and has provisions for communicating with other programs.
