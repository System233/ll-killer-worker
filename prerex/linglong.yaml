    course prerequisite chart editor for LaTeX/TikZ
    prerex is an editor for creating esthetically pleasing course prerequisite
    charts using the TikZ LaTeX package.

    The editor supports add, remove, cut-and-paste, and edit operations on
    diagram elements, and shifts of a list of specified elements or the
    entire diagram. The edited diagram may be saved, re-processed, and viewed in
    a PDF viewer, without exiting the editor.

    Course prerequisite charts allow students to easily determine which
    prerequisites, corequisites and recommended prerequisites they need for a
    given course and their time slots. Course prerequisite charts also highlight
    the courses required by a degree.

    prerex is used by departments in several universities, including Queen's
    University and Suffolk University.
