    compelling tile-placement puzzle game
    Primrose is a puzzle game by Jason Rohrer and a departure from his
    previous games.

    Primrose is an exploration into deep gameplay in single-player games. It
    is a tile clearing and placement game with chain reactions and without
    gravity or timing elements. The audio is limited to minimal but dynamic
    sound effects that change with game events and progress. It was designed
    as a casual but engaging and intelligent game for mobile phones.

    The player places pairs of coloured tiles on a 7x7 grid. Tiles are
    cleared by surrounding one colour group with another colour group,
    scoring points. The cleared tiles change the colour of the surrounding
    colour group, allowing for chain reactions that give more points. More
    colours are added as more tiles have been placed on the grid and
    eventually the game will end when the grid fills up.

    Primrose features a networked high score board with instant replay of
    the high scores, a comprehensive tutorial with animated examples, a
    colourblind mode, glowing, pulsating, retro graphics and synth-inspired
    sound effects.
