    virtual laser pointer for Logitech Spotlight devices
    Projecteur is a virtual laser pointer for use with inertial pointers such as
    the Logitech Spotlight. Projecteur can show a colored dot, a highlighted
    circle or a zoom effect to act as a pointer. The location of the pointer
    moves in response to moving the handheld pointer device. The effect is much
    like that of a traditional laser pointer, except that it is captured by
    recording software and works across multiple screens.
