  description: |-
    generic frontend for proof assistants
    Proof General is a major mode to turn Emacs into an interactive proof
    assistant to write formal mathematical proofs using a variety of
    theorem provers.

    This package provides Proof General support for Coq. (There is no
    other proof assistant that one could sensibly support.)
