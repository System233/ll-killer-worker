    simple wrapper that does Winetricks things for Proton
    Proton is a modified version of Wine used in Steam. This tool allows you to
    use Winetricks commands for games in Steam using Proton. This is often useful
    when a game requires closed-source runtime libraries that are not included
    with Proton.
