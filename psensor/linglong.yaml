    display graphs for monitoring hardware temperature
    Psensor is a GTK+ application for monitoring hardware sensors,
    including temperatures and fan speeds.

    It displays a curve for each sensor, alerts user using Desktop Notification
    and Application Indicator when a temperature is too high.

    It can monitor:
    * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using lm-sensors).
    * the temperature of the NVidia GPUs (using XNVCtrl).
    * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp or atasmart lib).
    * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm-sensors).
    * the sensors of a remote computer (using psensor-server).
