    Qt-based XMPP client (WebKit version)
    This package contains WebKit version of Psi+. In comparing with basic Psi+
    version it has few additional features: support of animated emoticons, support
    of (adium) themes in private chats and group chats, support of previewing of
    images and videos in private chats and group chats, etc..

    Psi IM is a capable XMPP client aimed at experienced users. There are
    keybindings for just about everything, Unicode is supported throughout,
    contacts are cached offline. Security is also a major consideration, and
    Psi IM provides it for both client-to-server (TLS) and client-to-client
    (GnuPG, OTR, OMEMO).

    Psi+ is a development branch of Psi IM. Project purposes are:
    implementation of new features, writing of patches and plugins for
    transferring them to Psi IM.
