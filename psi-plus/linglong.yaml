    Qt-based XMPP client (basic version)
    This package contains basic version of Psi+. Use it if you prefer old
    fashioned plain text chats from era of IRC heyday.

    Psi IM is a capable XMPP client aimed at experienced users. There are
    keybindings for just about everything, Unicode is supported throughout,
    contacts are cached offline. Security is also a major consideration, and
    Psi IM provides it for both client-to-server (TLS) and client-to-client
    (GnuPG, OTR, OMEMO).

    Psi+ is a development branch of Psi IM. Project purposes are:
    implementation of new features, writing of patches and plugins for
    transferring them to Psi IM.
