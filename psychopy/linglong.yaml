    environment for creating psychology stimuli in Python
    PsychoPy provides an environment for creating psychology stimuli
    using Python scripting language.  It combines the graphical
    strengths of OpenGL with easy Python syntax to give psychophysics
    a free and simple stimulus presentation and control package.

    The goal is to provide, for the busy scientist, tools to control
    timing and windowing and a simple set of pre-packaged stimuli and
    methods.  PsychoPy features

    - IDE GUI for coding in a powerful scripting language (Python)
    - Builder GUI for rapid development of stimulation sequences
    - Use of hardware-accelerated graphics (OpenGL)
    - Integration with Spectrascan PR650 for easy monitor calibration
    - Simple routines for staircase and constant stimuli experimental
    methods as well as curve-fitting and bootstrapping
    - Simple (or complex) GUIs via wxPython
    - Easy interfaces to joysticks, mice, sound cards etc. via PyGame
    - Video playback (MPG, DivX, AVI, QuickTime, etc.) as stimuli
