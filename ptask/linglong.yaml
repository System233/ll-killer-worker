    GTK+ graphical user interface for managing tasks
    ptask is a GTK+ graphical user interface for managing tasks.  It is based on
    taskwarrior, a well-known and robust command line tasks manager.  Unlike
    taskwarrior, it is possible to associate a note (long description) to each
    task.
