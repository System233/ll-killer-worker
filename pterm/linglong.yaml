    PuTTY terminal emulator
    This is an X terminal emulator based on the popular Windows SSH client,
    PuTTY. It supports xterm escape sequences, plus some Linux console
    sequences for colour palette configuration and some DECterm sequences for
    title bar control, and with an appropriate font it supports the UTF-8
    encoding of Unicode. It also has some nifty features like rectangular
    selection and NetHack keypad mode.
