    simple, powerful audio tag editor
    puddletag is an audio tag editor (primarily created) for GNU/Linux
    similar to the Windows program, Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for
    GNU/Linux, it uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you
    want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable.

    The usual tag editor features are supported like extracting tag
    information from filenames, renaming files based on their tags by
    using patterns and basic tag editing.

    Then there're Functions, which can do things like replace text, trim
    it, do case conversions, etc. Actions can automate repetitive
    tasks. You can import your QuodLibet library, lookup tags using
    Amazon (including cover art), Discogs (does cover art too!), FreeDB
    and MusicBrainz (and more).

    Supported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.),
    VorbisComments (ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkey's Audio (ape) and
    WavPack (wv).
