    realtime computer music and graphics system - GUI
    Pure Data (also known as Pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment
    for audio and graphics processing.

    This package provides the graphical user-interface for Pure Data.
    Most likely you will want to install "puredata-core" (or even "puredata")
    as well.
    Installing this package without the accompanying puredata-core is only useful
    if you want to run the GUI and the DSP on different machines.
