    Telnet/SSH client for X
    This is the Unix port of the popular Windows SSH client, PuTTY. It supports
    flexible terminal setup, mid-session reconfiguration using Ctrl-rightclick,
    multiple X11 authentication protocols, and various other interesting things
    not provided by ssh in an xterm.

    Pageant is an SSH authentication agent, and a tool for communicating with
    an already-running agent.
