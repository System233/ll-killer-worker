    Fast Azimuthal Integration scripts
    PyFAI is a Python library for azimuthal integration; it allows the conversion
    of diffraction images taken with 2D detectors like CCD cameras into X-Ray
    powder patterns that can be used by other software like Rietveld refinement
    tools (i.e. FullProf), phase analysis or texture analysis.

    As PyFAI is a library, its main goal is to be integrated in other tools like
    PyMca, LiMa or EDNA. To perform online data analysis, the precise description
    of the experimental setup has to be known. This is the reason why PyFAI
    includes geometry optimization code working on "powder rings" of reference
    samples. Alternatively, PyFAI can also import geometries fitted with other
    tools like Fit2D.

    PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector with any geometry
    (transmission, reflection, off-axis, ...). It uses the Python library FabIO
    to read most images taken by diffractometer.
