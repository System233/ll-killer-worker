    Molecular Graphics System
    PyMOL is a molecular graphics system targeted at medium to large
    biomolecules like proteins. It can generate high-quality publication-ready
    molecular graphics images and animations.

    Features include:
    * Visualization of molecules, molecular trajectories and surfaces
    of crystallography data or orbitals
    * Molecular builder and sculptor
    * Internal raytracer and movie generator
    * Fully extensible and scriptable via a Python interface

    File formats PyMOL can read include PDB, XYZ, CIF, MDL Molfile, ChemDraw,
    CCP4 maps, XPLOR maps and Gaussian cube maps.
