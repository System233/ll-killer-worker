    logging tool for amateur radio operators
    PyQSO is a logging tool for amateur radio operators. It provides a simple
    graphical interface through which users can manage information about the
    contacts/QSOs they make with other operators on the air. All information is
    stored in a light-weight SQL database. Other key features include:

    * Customisable interface (e.g. only show callsign and frequency information).
    * Import and export logs in ADIF format.
    * Perform callsign lookups and auto-fill data fields using the qrz.com
    database.
    * Sort the logs by individual fields.
    * Print a hard-copy of logs, or print to PDF.
    * Connect to Telnet-based DX clusters.
    * Progress tracker for the DXCC award.
    * Grey line plotter.
    * Filter out QSOs based on the callsign field (e.g. only display contacts
    with callsigns beginning with “M6”).
    * Remove duplicate QSOs.
    * Basic support for the Hamlib library.
