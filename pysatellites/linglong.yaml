  description: |-
    simulates the launching of satellites
    This program can be used to train people to spatial mechanics at an
    elementary level. You are given the power to launch a satellite, from
    outside the atmosphere, around a handful of predefined planets, or around
    any special object you may imagine. Input the initial velocity vector of the
    satellite, and you will get the simulated trajectory, as well as some
    information like the plots of variation of speed. As an extra, you can
    compute a movie, which represents the planet seen from the satellite's
    point of view during its orbital period.
