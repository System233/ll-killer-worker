  description: |-
    scientific tool for perpendicular line scanning FCS
    When a membrane is scanned perpendicularly to its surface,
    the fluorescence signal originating from the membrane itself
    must be separated from the signal of the surrounding medium for
    an FCS analysis. PyScanFCS interactively extracts the fluctuating
    fluorescence signal from such measurements and applies a multiple-tau
    algorithm. The obtained correlation curves can be evaluated using PyCorrFit.

    Package provides the Python module pyscanfcs and its graphical user interface.
    The graphical user interface is written in wxPython.
