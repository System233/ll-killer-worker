    cross-platform Python spreadsheet application
    Pyspread is a cross-platform Python spreadsheet application. Instead of
    spreadsheet formulas, Python expressions are entered into the spreadsheet
    cells. Each expression returns a Python object that can be accessed from
    other cells. These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.
