    n-dimensional array viewer in Python
    Fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's
    designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large
    multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI),
    vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python
    stack (numpy, scipy).
