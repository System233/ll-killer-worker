    GNU/Linux interactive application firewall GUI
    opensnitch-ui is a GUI for opensnitch written in Python.
    It allows the user to view live outgoing connections, as well as search
    for details of the intercepted connections.

    The user can decide if block outgoing connections based on properties of
    the connection: by port, by uid, by dst ip, by program or a combination
    of them.

    These rules can last forever, until restart the daemon or just one time.

    OpenSnitch can also work as a system-wide domains blocker, by using lists
    of domains, list of IPs or list of regular expressions.
