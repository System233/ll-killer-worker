    Pyzo is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on interactivity and introspection,
    which makes it very suitable for scientific computing. Its practical design is
    aimed at simplicity and efficiency.

    It consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and uses a set of
    pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways. Some example tools are
    source structure, project manager, interactive help, workspace...

    Pyzo is written in (pure) Python 3 and uses the Qt GUI toolkit. Binaries are
    provided for all major operating system. After installing Pyzo, it can be used
    to execute code on any Python version available on your system (Python 2.4 -
    3.x, including Pypy).
