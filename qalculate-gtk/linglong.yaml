    Powerful and easy to use desktop calculator - GTK+ version
    Qalculate! is small and simple to use but with much power and versatility
    underneath.  Features include customizable functions, units, arbitrary
    precision, plotting, and a graphical interface that uses a one-line
    fault-tolerant expression entry (although it supports optional traditional
    buttons).

    This package contains the GTK+ user interface of qalculate.
