    tool for installing deb files
    QApt is a collection of tools and a library providing a wrapper around
    APT. The intention is to ease the use of APT in Qt-based programs.

    The QApt deb installer allows you to install local .deb files. The QApt Deb
    Installer resolves and downloads dependencies. The APT package manager does
    the same, but only for remote packages.
command:
- /opt/apps/qapt-deb-installer.linyaps/files/entrypoint.sh
base: org.deepin.base/23.1.0
build: build-aux/setup.sh
