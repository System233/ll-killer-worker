    ALSA configuration browser
    QasTools is a collection of desktop applications for the
    Linux sound system ALSA.

    The applications included are:
    - QasConfig - browser for the ALSA configuration tree
    - QasHctl - mixer for ALSA's High level Control Interface
    - QasMixer - desktop mixer with features similar to alsamixer

    ALSA's configuration resides in a tree structure which gets built
    from the contents of the files /etc/asound.conf and ~/.asoundrc.
    QasConfig is a simple browser for this configuration tree and can
    help to analyze and debug an ALSA setup.
