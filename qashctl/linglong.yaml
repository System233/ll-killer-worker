    mixer for ALSA's High level Control Interface
    QasTools is a collection of desktop applications for the
    Linux sound system ALSA.

    The applications included are:
    - QasConfig - browser for the ALSA configuration tree
    - QasHctl - mixer for ALSA's High level Control Interface
    - QasMixer - desktop mixer with features similar to alsamixer

    QasHctl is a mixer application for ALSA's
    "High level Control Interface". This interface allows more complex
    interaction than the "Simple Mixer Interface" which is used by
