    Qt-based directory statistics
    QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space has gone and
    to help you to clean it up.

    QDirStat has a number of new features compared to KDirStat. To name a few:
    * Multi-selection in both the tree and the treemap.
    * Unlimited number of user-defined cleanup actions.
    * Properly show errors of cleanup actions (and their output, if desired).
    * File categories (MIME types) and their treemap color are now configurable.
    * Exclude rules for directories are easily configurable.
    * Desktop-agnostic; no longer relies on KDE or any other specific desktop.
