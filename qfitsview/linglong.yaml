    FITS file viewer based on DPUSER
    QFitsView is a FITS file viewer based on DPUSER. In addition to displaying
    two-dimensional images, it also provides means to explore three-dimensional
    data cubes. It integrates the functionality of DPUSER which can be accessed
    directly out of QFitsView.

    Note that this package was compiled with the giza library instead of PGPLOT,
    since the latter is non-free software.
