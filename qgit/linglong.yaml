    Qt application for viewing GIT trees
    With qgit you will be able to browse revision tree, view patch content
    and changed files, graphically following different development branches.
    Main features:
    - View revisions, diffs, files history, files annotation, archive tree.
    - Commit changes visually cherry picking modified files.
    - Apply or format patch series from selected commits, drag and
    drop commits between two instances of qgit.
    - qgit implements a GUI for the most common StGIT commands like push/pop
    and apply/format patches. You can also create new patches or refresh
    current top one using the same semantics of git commit, i.e.
    cherry picking single modified files.
