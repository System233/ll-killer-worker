    Go client and full featured SGF editor
    qGo is a computerized board on which you can play the game of Go
    against another player, view and edit smart-go files, and connect to
    Go servers on the internet. It can also interface with computer Go
    programs such as GNU Go that speak the Go modem protocol. Have a look
    at the cgoban package if you are interested in a Go client with less
    package dependencies.

    See description of the gnugo package for a short description of the
    game.
