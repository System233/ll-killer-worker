    Quick image viewer for X
    Quick Image Viewer (qiv) is a very small and pretty fast GDK/Imlib image
    viewer. Features include zoom, maxpect, scale down, fullscreen,
    brightness/contrast/gamma correction, slideshow, pan with keyboard and mouse,
    rotate left/right, flip, delete (move to .qiv-trash/), jump to image x, jump
    forward/backward x images, filename filter, and you can use qiv to set your
    X11-Desktop background.

    qiv also supports the assignment of external commands (like metacam) to unused
    keys.
