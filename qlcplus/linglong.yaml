    Control DMX or analog lighting systems
    Q Light Controller Plus is a software lighting desk for controlling
    DMX or analog lighting systems like moving heads, dimmers, scanners.

    This project is a fork of the great QLC project written by Heikki Junnila
    that aims to continue the QLC development and to introduce new features. The
    primary goal is to bring QLC+ at the level of other lighting control commercial
    software.
