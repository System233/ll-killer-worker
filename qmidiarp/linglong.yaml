    MIDI arpeggiator for ALSA
    QMidiArp is an advanced MIDI arpeggiator, programmable step sequencer
    and LFO for the ALSA sequencer. It can hold any number of arpeggiator,
    sequencer, or LFO modules running in parallel.

    Arpeggiator modules produce sequences depending on the notes sent
    to their input port, which is typically connected to a keyboard or
    another sequencer.

    Step sequencer modules allow one to create simple linear, monophonic
    and globally transposable sequences similar to the first analog
    sequencers.

    MIDI LFO modules independently produce MIDI controller data of
    adjustable waveform, time resolution, amplitude and duration.

    For each module, an input note filter is available, and the output
    port and channel can be set independently. Since the modules use a
    common sequencer queue, they are automatically in sync with each other.
    QMidiArp works with an internal tick resolution of 192 ticks per beat.
    The queue can be synchronized to an incoming MIDI realtime clock or as
    a JACK transport client. Most of the relevant control elements are
    accessible via MIDI controller through a MIDI-learn infrastructure.
    QMidiArp also has a log tool displaying the history of incoming MIDI
    events in colors depending on their type. QMidiArp is based on the Qt
    toolkit.
