    graphical application sending MIDI Machine Control commands over the network
    The MIDI Machine Control specification defines commands like Play,
    Pause and Record for remote control of audio recording equipment.

    Originally inspired by multimidicast, the qmidictl application
    imitates a MIDI control surface, on which the user selects commands
    to send over the network using UDP/IP multicast.
    Programs like qmidinet on Linux or ipMIDI on Windows can then forward
    the commands, for example to a concrete cable.
