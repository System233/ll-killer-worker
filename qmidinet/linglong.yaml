    MIDI Network Gateway via UDP/IP Multicast
    QmidiNet is a MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives
    MIDI data (ALSA Sequencer) over the network, using UDP/IP multicast.
    It was inspired by multimidicast (https://llg.cubic.org/tools) and
    designed to be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (https://nerds.de).
