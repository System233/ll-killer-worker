    Qt/QML module for Lomiri specific Mir APIs
    QtMir is a set of Qt5 components to enable one to write a Mir server with Qt.
    It contains a QPA (Qt Platform Abstraction) plugin which creates and manages
    a Mir server. It also exposes some internal Mir functionality.

    QtMir provides Qt/QML bindings for Mir features that are exposed through the
    qtmir QPA plugin such as Application management (start/stop/suspend/resume)
    and surface management.
