    Terminal app for Plasma Mobile
    This terminal application is optimized for touch devices and to integrate
    nicely in Plasma Mobile systems.

    It is based on Qmltermwidget (QML port of
    qtermwidget) and Kirigami (framework to design convergent apps with a user
    interface that adapts to desktops, phones, big screens and potentially
    everything else).

    It depends on Qt graphical libraries and a few KDE Frameworks.
