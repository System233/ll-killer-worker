    application that downloads Polish subtitles from www.napiprojekt.pl
    QNapi is a graphical downloader of subtitles from napiprojekt.pl and
    opensubtitles.org sites. Subtitles may be fetched in many different languages.

    QNapi's capabilities are similar to napiproject.pl's original client. New
    subtitles may be added to both, napiprojekt.pl and opensubtitles.org
    databases. Also bugs may be reported against existing subtitles.
