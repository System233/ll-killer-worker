    CD/DVD quality checker
    QPxTool gives you access to all available Quality Checks (Q-Checks) on written
    and blank media, that are available for your drive. This will help you to find
    the right media and the optimized writing speed for your hardware, which will
    increase the chance for a long data lifetime.

    QPxTool depends on the used drive, not all drives are able to read the Q-Checks
    and not all of them are supported by QPxTool. Currently, most newer drives of
    LiteOn, NEC, Pioneer and Plextor are supported.
