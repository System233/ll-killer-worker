    loudspeaker design software
    QSpeakers is a simple graphical program that
    simulates common acoustical enclosures behaviour
    to help designing loudspeaker systems, based on
    the loudspeaker driver's Thiele / Small parameters
    and the chosen enclosure type.

    This software is mostly useful for do-it-yourself
    loudspeaker enthusiasts, acoustics teaching, and
    to a lesser extent, for loudspeaker engineering.
