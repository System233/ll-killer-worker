    fluidsynth MIDI sound synthesiser front-end
    QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the Qt
    toolkit. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management application
    allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line softsynths
    but for the moment it wraps FluidSynth (http://www.fluidsynth.org).

    FluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont
    specification.
