    Qt HTML interpreter for TADS
    This package provides an interpreter for TADS game files, using a
    Qt interface.  It can run either TADS 2 games (which have an
    extension of .gam) or TADS 3 games (which have an extension of .t3).
    See http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXtads.html for a
    large collection of available TADS games.

    This interpreter supports HTML-TADS multimedia features.  Other
    features include:
    * Full Unicode support for TADS 3 and HTML TADS games.
    * Full text justification.
    * Support for multiple user configurations, which you can switch
    between at runtime.

    TADS, the Text Adventure Development System, is a system for writing
    and playing interactive fiction games.  This means that the primary
    method for interacting with the game is to type in commands, to which
    the game produces a response in prose -- similar to Infocom's games
    from the 1980's.
