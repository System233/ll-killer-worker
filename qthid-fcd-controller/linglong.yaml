    Funcube Dongle controller
    Controller application for the Funcube Dongle software defined radio receiver,
    built using the HID API library and the Qt GUI toolkit.

    The Funcube Dongle is a small software defined radio receiver for
    64 MHz - 1.7 GHz. It fits into a computer's USB port and uses USB audio
    to transfer complex I/Q data to SDR applications. The control API for
    setting frequency, gain, filter, etc. uses the USB HID standard.

    It provides full support for the Funcube Dongle API::
    * Change frequency and apply frequency correction.
    * Change RF gains and filters.
    * Change IF gains and filters.
    * LNA enhancement, bias current, etc.
    * I/Q correction.
    * Auto-repeat tuning buttons (click and hold button to scan).
    * Variable frequency step.
    * Upgrade and verify the firmware.
