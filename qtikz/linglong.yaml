    editor for the TikZ drawing language - Qt version
    QtikZ is a small application to assist in the creation of diagrams and
    drawings using the TikZ macros from the LaTeX package "pgf". It consists of
    a text editor pane in which the TikZ code for the drawing is edited and a
    preview pane showing the drawing as rendered by LaTeX. The preview pane can be
    updated in real-time. Common drawing tools, options and styles are available
    from the menus to assist the coding process.

    This package contains the Qt version of the program.

    TikZ is a user-friendly syntax layer for the PGF (portable graphics format)
    TeX macro package. Pictures can be created within a LaTeX document and
    included in the output using the most important TeX backend drivers including
    pdftex and dvips.
