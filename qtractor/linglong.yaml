    MIDI/Audio multi-track sequencer application
    This is a MIDI/Audio multi-track sequencer application written
    in C++.

    The Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced Linux
    Sound Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI, are the main infrastructures to
    evolve as a fairly-featured Linux Desktop Audio Workstation GUI, especially
    dedicated to the personal home-studio.
