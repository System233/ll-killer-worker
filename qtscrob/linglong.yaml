    audioscrobbler submitter for portable media players - Qt frontend
    qtscrob is a GUI tool which reads playback information from iPods,
    MTP (aka Plays for Sure) or Rockbox (open source audio player
    firmware) devices and submits them to an audioscrobbler service, such
    as "last.fm" or "libre.fm".

    This is the graphical version of the tool. For a CLI version, see the
    'scrobbler' package.
