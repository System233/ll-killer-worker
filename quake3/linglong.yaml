    Quake III Arena menu entry and launcher scripts
    This package contains a launcher script and menu entry to play
    Quake III Arena or Quake III: Team Arena with the ioquake3 engine.

    To make this package useful, you will need to create and install the
    non-distributable quake3-data or quake3-demo-data package, by using
    the game-data-packager package.

    quake3-data requires pak0.pk3 from a Quake III installation or CD-ROM.
    quake3-demo-data only requires freely downloadable files, but is
    not necessarily reliable.

    game-data-packager (>= 39) can also produce a package for the official
    expansion pack Quake III: Team Arena. An additional menu entry should appear
    automatically if that expansion are installed.
