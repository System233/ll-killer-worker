    distributed IRC client - monolithic core+client
    Quassel is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that
    one or more clients can attach to and detach from the central core. It's
    much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client
    such as WeeChat or irssi, but graphical.

    This package provides the monolithic client. It contains both core and
    client and can be used like a traditional IRC client, without requiring an
    external core.
