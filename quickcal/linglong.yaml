    fast and easy to use calculator with support for filing
    Quickcal accepts quick pasting of a large set of numbers, separated with
    newlines or spaces or tabs and performs arithmetic / statistical calculations
    based on the button or keyboard shortcut pressed.

    As in other calculators, basic math can be performed too, with the +,-,*,/,%,^
    operators, in between numbers. Setting the scale allows for more decimals to
    be displayed. Also, about 65 statistical calculations can be performed by
    choosing an option from the more stats list box.

    Filing and viewing support for history and tallying purpose, at the end of the
    day, helpful for shopkeepers and others too.
