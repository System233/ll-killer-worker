    Software Defined Radio (SDR)
    This is Quisk, a Software Defined Radio (SDR). You supply an antenna and a
    complex (I/Q) mixer to convert the radio spectrum to a low IF. Then send that
    IF to your computer using the sound card, Ethernet or USB. The Quisk software
    will read the I/Q data, tune it, filter it, demodulate it, and send the audio
    to headphones or speakers. Quisk has a microphone input and a key input so it
    can operate as a complete transceiver.

    Quisk works with this hardware:
    * SoftRock connected to the sound card
    * Many other SDR's connected to the sound card
    * SDR-IQ connected by USB
    * Perseus connected by USB
    * N2ADR hardware connected by Ethernet and IP
    * HiQSDR hardware connected by Ethernet and IP
    * The Hermes-Lite project at hermeslite.com
    * Quisk can be used as a pan adapter, and can control some radios

    Quisk is small and simple, and has been designed so that it is easy to change
    Quisk to suit your own hardware. Quisk rhymes with "brisk", and is QSK plus a
    few letters to make it easier to pronounce. QSK is a Q signal meaning full
    breakin CW operation, and Quisk has been designed for low latency. Quisk
    includes an input keying signal that can mute the audio and substitute a
    sidetone.
