    Small tool which may help yourself quit smoking
    QuitCount is a simple counter that shows what you spared since
    you quit smoking. Once you tell it the date you quit, how much
    you smoked, and how much it cost, it'll tell you how many
    cigarettes you didn't smoke since, and how much it makes in
    terms of money, tar, and life expectancy.
