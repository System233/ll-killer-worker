    Keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5
    qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's
    based on Python and PyQt5 and was inspired by other browsers/addons
    like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

    qutebrowser supports two different rendering engine backends:
    QtWebKit and QtWebEngine.
