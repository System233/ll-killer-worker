    GUI for FFmpeg
    This is a free and open source media converter frontend to FFmpeg. FFmpeg
    is a powerful command-line utility to convert audio and video file into
    numerous formats. QWinFF features a rich set of presets to help users use
    FFmpeg easily without having to manually input command-line flags. Average
    users can convert multiple media files in just a few clicks, while advanced
    users can still adjust conversion parameters in detail.
