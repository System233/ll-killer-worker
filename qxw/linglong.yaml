    advanced crossword construction tool
    Qxw is a program to help you create and publish crosswords,
    from the simplest blocked grid to sophisticated thematic
    puzzles. It can make rectangular-, hexagonal- or
    circular-format grids with blocks, bars or both. It
    has an automatic grid-filling facility that can handle a
    wide range of answer treatments and you can even add your
    own answer treatment methods. Grids can be filled using
    letters, digits, or a mixture of both; non-Roman and
    custom alphabets are also supported. Qxw can produce
    output in a range of formats ready for publication.

    Qxw also has a non-interactive mode that can solve a wide
    range of word-based constraint satisfaction problems and
    can help automate the exploration of grid designs.

    Qxw is written in C and has a GUI based on GTK+.
