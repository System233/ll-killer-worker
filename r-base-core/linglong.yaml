    GNU R core of statistical computation and graphics system
    R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
    of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
    access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
    stored in script files.

    The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
    Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
    resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
    implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.

    The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
    branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
    Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
    possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
    C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
    functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
    large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
    computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
    a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
    presentations.

    Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available
    from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian
    packages, named 'r-cran-<name>'.

    This package provides the core GNU R system from which only the optional
    documentation packages r-base-html, r-doc-html, r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info
    have been split off to somewhat reduce the size of this package.
