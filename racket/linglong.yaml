    extensible programming language in the Scheme family
    Racket (previously PLT Scheme) is a programming language suitable for
    scripting and application development, including GUIs and web
    services.

    It supports the creation of new programming languages through a rich,
    expressive syntax system. Supplied languages include Typed Racket,
    ACL2, FrTime, and Lazy Racket, and R6RS Scheme.

    Racket includes the DrRacket programming environment, a virtual
    machine with a just-in-time compiler, tools for creating stand-alone
    executables, the Racket web server, extensive libraries, and
    documentation for both beginners and experts.
