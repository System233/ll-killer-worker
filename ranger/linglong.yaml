    Console File Manager with VI Key Bindings
    Ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings.  It provides a
    minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy.
    It ships with "rifle", a file launcher that is good at automatically finding
    out which program to use for what file type.

    Design Goals
    * An easily maintainable file manager in a high level language
    * A quick way to switch directories and browse the file system
    * Keep it small but useful, do one thing and do it well
    * Console based, with smooth integration into the unix shell
