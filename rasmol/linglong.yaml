    visualization of biological macromolecules
    RasMol is a molecular graphics program intended for the visualisation of
    proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. The program is aimed at
    display, teaching and generation of publication quality images.

    The program reads in a molecule coordinate file and interactively displays
    the molecule on the screen in a variety of colour schemes and molecule
    representations. Currently available representations include depth-cued
    wireframes, 'Dreiding' sticks, spacefilling (CPK) spheres, ball and stick,
    solid and strand biomolecular ribbons, atom labels and dot surfaces.

    Supported input file formats include Protein Data Bank (PDB), Tripos
    Associates' Alchemy and Sybyl Mol2 formats, Molecular Design Limited's
    (MDL) Mol file format, Minnesota Supercomputer Center's (MSC) XYZ (XMol)
    format, CHARMm format, CIF format and mmCIF format files.

    This package installs two versions of RasMol, rasmol-gtk has a modern
    GTK-based user interface and rasmol-classic is the version with the old
    Xlib GUI.
