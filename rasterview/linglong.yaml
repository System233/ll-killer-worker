    CUPS/PWG/Apple raster file viewer
    RasterView is a CUPS, PWG, and Apple raster file viewing application.
    It basically allows you to look at the raster data produced by any of
    the standard CUPS RIP filters (cgpdftoraster, imagetoraster,
    pdftoraster, and pstoraster) and is normally used to either test those
    filters or look at the data that is being sent to your raster printer
    driver.
