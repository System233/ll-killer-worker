    Adjusts the color temperature of your screen -- GUI
    The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
    different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
    twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
    from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly
    adapt.

    This package installs a graphical user interface for redshift.
