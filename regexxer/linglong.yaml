    visual search and replace tool using Perl Regex
    Regexxer is a nifty GUI search/replace tool featuring Perl-style
    regular expressions (PCRE - Perl Regex). If you need project-wide
    substitution and you're tired of hacking sed command lines together,
    then you should definitely give it a try.

    The tool can be used to search files or contents inside of a file.
command:
- /opt/apps/regexxer.linyaps/files/entrypoint.sh
