    free implementation of Flashback game engine
    REminiscence is a free re-implementation of the game engine used to run the
    Flashback platform action game. It uses the data files from the original
    PC/DOS game and can make use of the Amiga sound files.

    Flashback is a platform action game, in which you control a character that has
    lost his memory. Your task is to bring the memories back and, ultimately, save
    the world.
