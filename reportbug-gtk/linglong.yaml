    reports bugs in the Debian distribution (GTK+ UI)
    reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
    and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:

    * Integration with many mail user agents.
    * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
    * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
    * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
    * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
    * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.

    Bug reporting in Debian relies on email; reportbug can use a local
    mail transport agent (like exim or sendmail), submit directly through
    an external mail server, or pass messages to an installed mail user
    agent (e.g., mutt) for submission.

    This package contains a desktop file and icon, and has dependencies
    to enable the GTK+ UI mode of reportbug to work.
