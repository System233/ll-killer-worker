    better desktop integration for Element
    Revolt is a small application which wraps the Element webapp to provide better
    integration with desktop environments in general, and GNOME in particular:

    * Having Element as a "standalone" application with its own window, launcher,
    icon, etc. instead of it living in a browser tab.
    * Persistent notifications (for desktop environments supporting them, i.e.
    GNOME). Notifications are automatically prevented when the Revolt window
    is focused.
    * Status icon for desktop environment which have a tray bar applet (XFCE,
    Budgie, likely many others).

    Element is a chat client for Matrix, an open, federated communications
    protocol.
