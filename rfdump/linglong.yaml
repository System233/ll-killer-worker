    tool to decode RFID tag data
    RFDump is a tool to decode RFID tags and show their meta information:
    tag ID, tag type, manufacturer etc. The user data memory of a tag can
    be displayed and modified using either a hex or an ASCII editor. In
    addition, the integrated cookie feature demonstrates how easy it is
    for a company to abuse RFID technology to spy on their customers.
    RFDump works with the ACG multi-tag reader or similar card reader
    hardware.
