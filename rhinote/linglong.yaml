    virtual sticky-notes for your desktop
    Rhinote is a small program that provides virtual sticky-notes. It's handy
    for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text that you plan to paste
    elsewhere later.

    Notes can be saved as plain text for later viewing/editing with Rhinote or
    any other text editor.

    Rhinote is designed to be "keyboard friendly", that is, every single action
    is bound to a specific keystroke.
