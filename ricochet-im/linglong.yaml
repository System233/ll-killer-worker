    anonymous metadata-resistant instant messaging
    Ricochet is an experiment with a different kind of instant messaging that
    doesn't trust anyone with your identity, your contact list, or your
    communications.

    - You can chat without exposing your identity (or IP address) to anyone
    - Nobody can discover who your contacts are or when you talk (metadata-free)
    - There are no servers or operators to compromise that could access your
    information
    - It's cross-platform and easy for non-technical users

    Ricochet is a peer-to-peer instant messaging system built on Tor hidden
    services. Your login is your hidden service address, and contacts connect to
    you (not an intermediate server) through Tor. The rendezvous system makes it
    extremely hard for anyone to learn your identity from your address.

    Ricochet is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Tor Project. For more
    information, you can read about Tor and learn about Ricochet's design or
    protocol (or the old protocol). Everything is open-source and open to
    contribution.

    **This software is an experiment**. It hasn't been audited or formally
    reviewed by anyone. Security and anonymity are difficult topics, and you
    should carefully evaluate your risks and exposure with any software. Do not
    rely on Ricochet for your safety.
