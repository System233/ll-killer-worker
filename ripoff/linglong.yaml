    modular and intuitive GTK+-based CD-ripper
    RipOff is a GTK+ based CD Ripper for Linux that sports a simple interface,
    CDDB lookups, and a plugin-based encoder architecture.

    This version doesn't have MP3 support compiled in, you'll need to install
    the ripoff-mp3-plugin package to rip into mp3.

    This package contains the ripoff executable.
