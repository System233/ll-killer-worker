    GTK+ frontend to rmlint
    rmlint-gui (a.k.a. Shredder) is a graphical user interface to rmlint
    using GTK+. It uses rmlint to find space waste and other broken things
    on your filesystem and offers to remove them.

    It is able to find:
    * Duplicate files & directories.
    * Non-stripped binaries.
    * Broken symlinks.
    * Empty files.
    * Recursive empty directories.
    * Files with broken user or group ID.

    Key Features:
    * Extremely fast.
    * Flexible and easy command-line options.
    * Choice of several hashes for hash-based duplicate detection.
    * Option for exact byte-by-byte comparison (only slightly slower).
    * Numerous output options.
    * Option to store time  of last run; next time will only scan new files.
    * Many options for original selection/prioritisation.
    * Can handle very large file sets (millions of files).
