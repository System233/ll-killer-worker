    Zen Simulation of robot finding kitten
    In this simulation, you play the part of robot. Your task is to
    complete the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and
    indeed your wont.  You (robot) are represented by the # character, and
    you move around with the arrow keys touching things.  If the thing you
    touch is kitten, you get a cute little animation (which was cuter in
    the DOS version) and the simulation ends. Otherwise, you get a brief
    description of what it is you touched.
