    graph theory IDE
    Rocs aims to be a Graph Theory IDE for helping professors to show the results
    of a graph algorithm and also helping students to do the algorithms.

    Rocs has a scripting module, done in Qt Script, that interacts with the drawn
    graph and every change in the graph with the script is reflected on the drawn
    one.

    This package is part of the KDE education module.
