    utility to help prevent repetitive strain injury
    Prolonged use of a mouse and keyboard can cause a repetitive strain injury
    (RSI), so computer users are advised to take regular breaks.

    RSIBreak helps prevent repetitive strain injuries by keeping track of usage
    patterns and periodically informing users to take breaks.  During break
    periods, RSIBreak can either show an unobtrusive message, lock the screen
    entirely, or present a slideshow.
