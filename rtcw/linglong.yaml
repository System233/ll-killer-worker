    game engine for Return to Castle Wolfenstein
    Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a military- and occult-themed first-person
    shooter game in a Second World War setting, originally released in 2001.
    It is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, which is also available for Debian
    (in the wolf4sdl package).

    This package contains the iortcw game engines for the single-player campaign
    and multiplayer, based on ioquake3 and the GPL source releases of RTCW.

    For security reasons, this version has been modified to prevent native
    executable code from being unpacked from game packages (PK3 files).
    Some game modifications will not work as a result of this change.

    Return to Castle Wolfenstein requires non-distributable game data files
    in the rtcw-data package, prepared using the game-data-packager tool.
