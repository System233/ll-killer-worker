    Multiplayer online game set in a fantasy world
    This software is a simple script that downloads and runs
    the Old School Runescape client file on unofficial GNU/Linux distributions.

    The game works on several different platforms (supported or not by Jagex)
    using Java installed on the system, avoiding common risks encountered
    by players using a web browser.

    After downloading the official client file, the script will prepare the sandbox
    environment located in "$HOME/.local/share/runescape" and run the game.

    About the game, you will explore in an open and mysterious world,
    with devastated landscapes and sinister powers.

    Having chosen an adventurer, players are free to find their role
    within it: to live by the sword and spells facing hundreds
    of enemies, to further the storyline in quests, or to train
    in any of a number of skills.
