    RXVT-like terminal emulator with Unicode and 256-color support
    rxvt-unicode is a modern, Unicode-aware color xterm replacement that uses
    significantly less memory than a conventional xterm and many other Unicode
    supporting terminal emulators.

    It supports using multiple fonts at the same time, including Xft fonts, and
    client-server technology to reduce memory consumption when using multiple
    windows.

    This package is configured with 256-color support, and TERM set to
    "rxvt-unicode-256color". Any other systems you log into must have this
    terminfo entry installed!
