    GNOME UPnP/DLNA services - preferences tool
    Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video
    and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In technical
    terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through
    a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is
    achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA and on the fly
    conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.

    This package provides a graphical tool to configure Rygel and set
    custom preferences. Normally you'd configure your sharing preferences
    with GNOME Control Center and not need this tool.
