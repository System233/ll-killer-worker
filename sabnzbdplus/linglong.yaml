    web-based binary newsreader with nzb support
    SABnzbd+ is a web-based binary newsgrabber written in Python, with support for
    the popular nzb file format. It greatly simplifies the process of downloading
    from Usenet, thanks to a friendly web-based, fully customizable user interface
    and advanced built-in post-processing options including the ability to
    automatically verify, repair, extract and clean up downloaded posts.

    Multiple servers are supported, as well as secure (ssl) connections, ipv6,
    scheduling, pausing and resuming downloads, queue manipulation, rss feeds,
    automatic sorting, a download history, email notifications, and custom
    post-processing scripts. An extensive API allows third party applications to
    interact with the program.

    This package contains the program itself and all interface templates.
