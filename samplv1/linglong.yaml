    polyphonic sampler synthesizer - standalone
    samplv1 is an old-school all-digital polyphonic sampler
    synthesizer with stereo effects.

    Although other samplers like specimen provide more features,
    one could find samplv1 much easier and accessible. Plus, it
    is provided in both forms of a JACK stand-alone client and
    a LV2 plugin.

    This package provides the standalone app.
