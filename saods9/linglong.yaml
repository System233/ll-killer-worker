    Image display tool for astronomy
    SAOImage DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization
    application. DS9 supports FITS images and binary tables, multiple frame
    buffers, region manipulation, and many scale algorithms and colormaps. It
    provides for easy communication with external analysis tasks and is highly
    configurable and extensible via XPA and SAMP.

    All versions and platforms support a consistent set of GUI and
    functional capabilities.

    DS9 supports advanced features such as 2-D, 3-D and RGB frame buffers, mosaic
    images, tiling, blinking, geometric markers, colormap manipulation, scaling,
    arbitrary zoom, cropping, rotation, pan, and a variety of coordinate
    systems.

    The GUI for DS9 is user configurable. GUI elements such as the coordinate
    display, panner, magnifier, horizontal and vertical graphs, button bar, and
    color bar can be configured via menus or the command line.
