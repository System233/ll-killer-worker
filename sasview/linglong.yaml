    Small Angle Scattering Analysis suite
    SasView is software for the analysis of Small-Angle Scattering (SAS)
    data.

    It fits analytic functions describing different types of material
    microstructure to experimental data in order to determine the shape,
    size and degree of ordering.

    SasView also includes tools for calculating scattering length
    densities, slit sizes, resolution, fringe thicknesses/d-spacings, the
    (Porod) invariant ('total scattering'), and distance distribution
    functions.

    SasView is a Small Angle Scattering Analysis Software Package,
    originally developed as part of the NSF DANSE project under the name
    SansView, now managed by an international collaboration of facilities.

    This package installs the sasview executable script.
