    satellite constellation visualisation
    SaVi allows you to simulate satellite orbits and coverage,
    in two and three dimensions. SaVi is particularly useful for
    simulating satellite constellations such as Iridium and Globalstar.

    SaVi can use Geomview, an optional but useful package,
    for 3D rendering.
