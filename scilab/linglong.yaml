    Scientific software package for numerical computations
    Scilab is a matrix-based scientific software package.
    Scilab contains hundreds of built-in mathematical functions, rich
    data structures (including polynomials, rationals, linear systems, lists,
    etc...) and comes with a number of specific toolboxes for control, signal
    processing, ...

    This package also provides Xcos, a graphical editor to design hybrid
    dynamical systems models. Models can be designed, loaded, saved, compiled and
    simulated.
    Stable and efficient solution for industrial and academics needs, Xcos
    provides functionalities for modeling of mechanical systems (automotive,
    aeronautics...), hydraulic circuits (dam, pipe modeling...), control systems,
    etc. Modelica capabilities are also provided.

    For a minimum version of scilab, install package "scilab-cli".
