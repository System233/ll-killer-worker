    smart common input method platform
    Smart Common Input Method (SCIM) is an input method (IM) platform.  Input
    methods are needed to enter complex characters in many non-latin languages.
    SCIM provides a common platform for various plugin modules and independent IM
    programs, as well as a set of modules and programs on its own.  It is highly
    modularized and exposes abstract interfaces, so that plugin modules with
    different functions can easily communicate with each other.  The currently
    supported module types are configuration, IM engine, front end, filter, and
    setup GUI.

    SCIM achieves the communication between IM engines and front ends through
    both shared library linking and server/client mode.  It supports XIM
    protocol, as well as GTK+ IM module.

    This package is the main binary package of SCIM.  It includes: the main
    program scim (GTK+ based) and other support programs; simple configuration
    module, X11 front end module, rawcode IM engine module,
    simplified/traditional Chinese conversion filter module, and their
    corresponding setup GUI modules; GTK+ panel and its setup GUI module; and a
    GTK+ based setup tool.

    SCIM is a well accepted platform and features various input method engines
    for many languages.  In Debian you can find the following separately packaged
    IMs useful: scim-tables-{additional,ja,ko,zh}, scim-pinyin, scim-uim,
    scim-m17n, scim-chewing, scim-anthy, scim-canna, scim-prime, and scim-skk.
    GTK+ users would also find package scim-gtk-immodule useful for GTK+ IM
    module support.

    For development on SCIM platform, please see the description of scim-dev
    package.
