    easy to use programming environment for ages 8 and up
    Scratch is an easy, interactive, collaborative programming
    environment designed for creation of interactive stories, animations,
    games, music, and art -- and sharing these on the web.
    Scratch is designed to help young people (ages 8 and up) develop 21st
    century learning skills. As they create Scratch projects, young people
    learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while also
    gaining a deeper understanding of the process of design.
