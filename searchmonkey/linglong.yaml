    search files using regular expressions aiming to replace find/grep tools
    SearchMonkey is a light-weight Gtk application that aims to replace the
    cumbersome find/grep with a slick user interface that quickly provides a
    mark-up showing locations and quantity of text matches.
    The goal is to provide a simple to use and accessible search tool for
    end-users, and software developers alike.
