  description: |-
    Multiplatform interface for sequence alignment and phylogeny
    SeaView is a viewer and editor of multiple sequence alignments, i.e.
    DNA or protein sequences are positioned each in their own separate line,
    such that the nucleotide/amino acid at a particular position (column) is
    presumed to have the same biochemical property.

    SeaView reads and writes various file formats (NEXUS, MSF, CLUSTAL, FASTA,
    PHYLIP, MASE, Newick) of DNA and protein sequences and of phylogenetic trees.
    Alignments can be manually edited. It drives the programs Muscle or Clustal
    Omega for multiple sequence alignment, and also allows one to use any external
    alignment algorithm able to read and write FASTA-formatted files. It computes
    phylogenetic trees by parsimony using PHYLIP's dnapars/protpars algorithm, by
    distance with NJ or BioNJ algorithms on a variety of evolutionary distances, or
    by maximum likelihood using the program PhyML 3.0.

    SeaView draws phylogenetic
    trees on screen or PostScript files, and allows one to download sequences from
    EMBL/GenBank/UniProt using the Internet.
