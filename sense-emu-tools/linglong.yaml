    Emulator for the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.
    sense-emu is an emulator of the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT which runs on multiple
    platforms, and provides an emulation of each sensor on the HAT, along with the
    pixel display and the joystick. The API is exactly the same as the official
    API, meaning code developed against the emulator should require no more than
    a one word change to run on the actual HAT.

    This is the tools (GUI and command line) for the emulator.
