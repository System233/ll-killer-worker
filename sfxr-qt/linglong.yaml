    sound effect generator, QtQuick port of sfxr
    This little tool was made to provide a simple means of getting basic sound
    effects into a game. You just need to hit a few buttons in this application
    to get some largely randomized effects. All the parameters used to create
    each sound are manually tweakable to allow fine-tuning if you feel like
    getting your hands dirty.
