    feature-rich screenshot program
    Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program. You can take a
    screenshot of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of
    a website - apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight
    points, and then upload to an image hosting site, all within one
    window.

    Features:
    * take a screenshot of your complete desktop, a rectangular area
    * take screenshot directly or with a specified delay time
    * save the screenshots to a specified directory and name them in a
    convenient way (using special wild-cards)
    * Shutter is fully integrated into the GNOME Desktop (TrayIcon etc.)
    * generate thumbnails directly when you are taking a screenshot
    and set a size level in %
    * Shutter session collection
    o keep track of all screenshots during session
    o copy screeners to clipboard
    o print screenshots
    o delete screenshots

    * upload your files directly to Image-Hosters (e.g. imgur.com), retrieve
