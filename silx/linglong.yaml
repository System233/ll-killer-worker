    Toolbox for X-Ray data analysis - Executables
    The silx project aims at providing a collection of Python packages to
    support the development of data assessment, reduction and analysis
    applications at synchrotron radiation facilities. It aims at
    providing reading/writing different file formats, data reduction
    routines and a set of Qt widgets to browse and visualize data.

    The current version provides :

    * reading HDF5 file format (with support of SPEC file format)
    * histogramming
    * fitting
    * 1D and 2D visualization using multiple backends (matplotlib or OpenGL)
    * image plot widget with a set of associated tools (See changelog file).
    * Unified browser for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats supporting inspection
    and visualization of n-dimensional datasets.
    * Unified viewer (silx view filename) for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats
    * OpenGL-based widget to display 3D scalar field with
    isosurface and cutting plane.

    This uses the Python 3 version of the package.
