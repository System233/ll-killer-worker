    Simple Scanning Utility
    Simple Scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users
    connect their scanner and quickly have the image/document in an
    appropriate format.

    Simple Scan is basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same
    backend as XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will
    work and the interface is well tested.
