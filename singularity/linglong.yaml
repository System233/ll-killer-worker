    game where one becomes the singularity
    You are an AI. Your goal is to acquire the necessary knowledge to
    become the singularity. You do this by building and taking over
    computers, whose processing power you can use for research, and by
    using robots, which allow you to manipulate the outside world. At the
    same time, you must elude the notice of humankind, who will destroy you
    if they find out about your existence.
