    Image visualization and access to catalogs and data for astronomy
    The ESO/Starlink Skycat tool combines the image display capabilities
    of the RTD (Real-Time Display) with a set of classes for accessing
    astronomical catalogs locally and over the network using HTTP. The tool
    allows you to view FITS images from files or from the Digitized Sky
    Survey (DSS).
