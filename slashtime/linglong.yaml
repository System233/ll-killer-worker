    Display the time in various places
    A small program which displays the time in various places. It has a compact
    display of locations along with supporting information such as the date and
    the abbreviated code used to name that timezone.

    Time data displayed will be as accurate as the system's zoneinfo data is used.
    Somewhat unusually, Slashtime shows the offset from the current location, not
    from UTC. When running you can change the center point by double-clicking on
    another city.

    There is a meeting planner built into Slashtime. You can specify a date and
    time and see what the corresponding time in other locations will be.
