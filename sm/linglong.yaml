    Displays a short text fullscreen
    Screen Message will display a given multi-line message as large as
    possible, fullscreen and black on white. You can specify the text either
    when launching sm, or edit it while the program is running.

    It is useful to send messages across a room, e.g. during an university
    lecture. For fast startup, it is recommended to bind it to a key in your
    Desktop Environment.
