    graphical user interface for snapper
    Snapper-gui is a graphical user interface for the tool snapper
    for Linux filesystem snapshot management. It can compare snapshots
    and revert differences between snapshots. In simple terms, this
    allows root and non-root users to view older versions of files and
    revert changes

    Currently works with btrfs, ext4 and thin-provisioned LVM volumes
command:
