    Host binary version of Snek programming language
    Snek is a small python-like language designed for embedded
    computers. It can run on systems as small as an Arduino Duemilanove
    board, which is an ATmega 328 processor with 32kB of flash and 2kB of
    ram. This package provides a host snek binary for playing with the
    language on your host machine.
