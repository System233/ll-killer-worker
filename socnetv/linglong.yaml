    Social Networks Analysis and Visualization software
    SocNetV (Social Network Visualiser) is a flexible and
    user-friendly tool for Social Networks Analysis and Visualisation.
    It lets you create new networks (graphs) with a few clicks on a
    virtual canvas or load networks of various formats (GraphML,
    GraphViz, Adjacency, UCINET, Pajek, etc) and modify them to suit
    your needs.

    The application can compute network properties, such as density,
    diameter and geodesic distances, as well as node-wise and network
    indices such as various types of Centrality and Prestige.
    Various layout algorithms (i.e. Spring-embedder, circular and in
    levels according to prominence indices) are supported for
    meaningful visualisations of your networks. Furthermore, it can
    create various random networks (Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz,
    ring lattice, etc) with a few clicks.
