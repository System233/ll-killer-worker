    Ear training software
    GNU Solfege is an ear training program for X Windows written in Python,
    using the GTK+ 3.0 libraries. You can practice harmonic and
    melodic intervals, chords, scales and rhythms, and you can add new
    exercises using a simple plain text file format.

    Ear training is a big subject with many connections to music theory
    and performance of music.

    To use this software, you need some basic knowledge about music theory.
