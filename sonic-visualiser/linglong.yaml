    viewing and analysing the contents of music audio files
    The aim of Sonic Visualiser is to be the first program you reach for
    when want to study a musical recording rather than simply listen to it.

    Sonic Visualiser could be of particular interest to musicologists,
    archivists, signal-processing researchers and anyone else looking for a
    friendly way to take a look at what lies inside the audio file.
