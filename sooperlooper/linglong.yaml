    Looping Sampler
    SooperLooper is a live looping sampler capable of immediate loop recording,
    overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more. It allows for multiple
    simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your computer's available
    memory.

    The application is a standalone JACK client with an engine controllable via
    OSC and MIDI. It also includes a GUI which communicates with the engine via
    OSC (even over a network) for user-friendly control on a desktop.
