    Multi-panel tabbed file manager
    SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with
    built-in VFS, udev or HAL-based device manager, customizable menu system
    and bash integration.

    A descendant of PCManFM, SpaceFM's aims are to be bugfixed, efficient
    (mainly C), hugely customisable (change and add to the GUI as you go
    with Design Mode), powerful without scaring off newer users (due to
    customisation), independent of particular distributions and desktop
    environments, and device management featureful enough to replace the
    various udisks-based *kits when used alongside udevil.

    Other highlights include optional desktop management, smart queuing
    of file operations, user plugins and the ability to carry out specific
    commands as root.
