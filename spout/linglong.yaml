    Tiny abstract black and white 2D cave-shooter
    This is a small, abstract shooting game from Japanese developer Kuni. It is a
    'caveflier' in which the exhaust from the engine also serves as a tool to
    erode the cave walls.

    Your goal is to fly upwards as long as you possibly can, without crashing
    against the cave walls and the window borders.
