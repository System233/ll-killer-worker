    virtual machine for Smalltalk
    Squeak is a full-featured implementation of the Smalltalk programming
    language and environment based on (and largely compatible with) the
    original Smalltalk-80 system.

    This package contains just the Unix Squeak virtual machine.  You will
    likely need also an image file containing a "snapshot" of a live Squeak
    session - e.g. one of the Debian packages etoys or scratch.
