    Enhanced TightVNC viewer with SSL/SSH tunnel helper
    VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
    display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop'
    environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from
    anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine
    architectures.

    SSVNC is two things:

    * An enhanced version of the TightVNC client with support for more
    encodings and color modes, support for x11vnc and UltraVNC
    extensions, dynamic screen resizing, an improved popup menu, etc.

    * A GUI that helps set up an SSL (using stunnel) or SSH tunnel to
    connect to the VNC server through, as well as forwarding of ports for
    audio (esound/aRts), SMB, CUPS etc.
