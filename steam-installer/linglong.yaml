    Valve's Steam digital software delivery system
    Steam (https://www.steampowered.com) is a software content delivery system
    developed by Valve software (https://www.valvesoftware.com).  There is
    some free software available, but for the most part the content delivered
    is non-free.

    This package provides a script that downloads and installs the Steam client,
    and depends on 32-bit and 64-bit libraries and other components that are
    required by the Steam client. The actual Steam installation and all Steam
    games will be installed into the home directory of each user who runs
    the installer script.

    Because Steam requires 32-bit libraries, before installing this package it
    will be necessary to run, as root:

    dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update

    Use of Steam is subject to several license agreements and other legal
    terms. Please see <https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/>
