    Stella is a portable emulator of the old Atari 2600 video-game

    controllers using the host system's input peripherals;
    * emulation of trackballs, joysticks, booster grips, driving
    controllers and the Amiga Mouse using the host system's mouse;
    * support for real Atari 2600 controllers using the Stelladaptor,
    2600-daptor or 2600-daptor II;
    * support for real Atari 7800 controllers using the 2600-daptor II;
    * support for the speech portion of a real AtariVox device;
    * support for Supercharger single-load and multi-load games;
    * emulation of CRT TV features, including texturing, colour bleed,
    RF noise and phosphor burn-off (requires OpenGL).
