    Software Token for cryptographic authentication
    stoken is a software token which generates one-time passwords compatible
    with RSA SecurID 128-bit (AES) tokens.  SecurID tokens are commonly
    used to authenticate end users to protected network resources and VPNs,
    as OTPs provide greater resistance to many attacks associated with static
    passwords.

    stoken aims to provide a Linux-friendly, free software alternative to the
    proprietary RSA SecurID Software Authenticators.

    This package contains standalone command-line and GTK+ GUI programs that
    allow for importing token seeds, generating tokencodes, and various
    utility/testing functions.
