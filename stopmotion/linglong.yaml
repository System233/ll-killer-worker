    create stop-motion animations
    Create stop-motion animations with images grabbed from a video
    device, or from image files, or from still images extracted from
    video.  Stopmotion has a set of tools which helps you keep the
    movements smooth and precise, such as ghosting the last image on a
    live view of the next image to be acquired.
