    Browser for Internet Radio Stations
    streamtuner2 is a browser for radio station directories. It can fetch lists
    from SHOUTcast, Xiph.org, Live365, Jamendo, DMOZ, basic.ch, Punkcast.
    And it lists stream entries by category or genre. It reuses existing audio
    players, and recording is delegated to streamripper.

    It mimics the original streamtuner 0.99.99, but is easier to extend because
    it's written entirely in Python. It's already in a stable and useable form.
