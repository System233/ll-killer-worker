    application for creating 3D structures
    Structure Synth is a tool for generating 3D structures by specifying a
    design grammar. Even simple systems may generate surprising and complex
    structures. Structure Synth offers a graphical environment with multiple
    tabs, syntax highlighting, and OpenGL preview. Integration with third-party
    renderers (such as Sunflow and POV-Ray) is possible using a flexible
    template based export system.

    Structure Synth has been developed by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. It was
    inspired by the CFDG syntax by Chris Coyne, and the Context Free Art GUI by
    Mark Lentczner and John Horigan.
