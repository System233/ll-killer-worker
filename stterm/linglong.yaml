    simple terminal emulator for X
    st is a terminal emulator from the suckless project with a focus on
    simplicity, clarity and frugality. The project's philosophy is about
    keeping things simple, minimal and usable.

    st supports most VT10X escape sequences, serial lines, XIM, utmp via
    utmp(1), clipboard handling, mouse and keyboard shortcuts, UTF-8, wide
    characters, resize, 256 colors, true colors, antialiased fonts (using
    fontconfig), fallback fonts, and line drawing. It does *not* provide
    a scrollback buffer: users are encouraged to use a terminal multiplexter.

    This Debian package is called 'stterm' for historical reasons.
