    Studio Controls - Jack Audio Configuration Tool
    Studio Controls is a small application that enables/disables realtime
    privilege for users and controls jackdbus. It allows Jackdbus to be run from
    session start. It also will detect USB audio devices getting plugged in after
    session start and optionally connect them to jackdbus as a client or switch
    them in as jackdbus master.
