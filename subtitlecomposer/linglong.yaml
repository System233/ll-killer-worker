    text-based subtitle editor
    A text-based subtitles editor supporting basic operations (text, time and
    style edition), realtime previewing and spell checking. Other fancy features
    are delaying all subtitles in the current subtitle file, checking errors or
    creating translations.

    Different backends (GStreamer, MPlayer, MPV, or Phonon) can be used to play
    the realtime video preview which helps to synchronize the subtitles.
