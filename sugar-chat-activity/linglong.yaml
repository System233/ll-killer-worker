    Sugar Learning Platform - text chatting activity
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning
    through Sugar Activities that encourage critical thinking,
    the heart of a quality education.
    Designed from the ground up especially for children,
    Sugar offers an alternative to traditional "office-desktop" software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.
    They are software packages that automatically save your work -
    producing specific instances of the Activity
    that can be resumed at a later time.
    Many Activities support learner collaboration,
    where multiple learners may be invited
    to join a collective Activity session.

    The Chat activity provides a simple interface
    for collaborative discussion,
    be it between two individuals or among a group
    as large as an entire classroom.
    Use Neighborhood View to invite particular people to Chat,
    or share for a public conversation.
    It uses Sugar collaboration mechanism
    for launching and joining chats
    so you can use it even without internet.
