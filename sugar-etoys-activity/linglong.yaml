    Etoys activity for Sugar Learning Platform
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
    Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
    education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
    offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
    packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
    instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
    Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
    be invited to join a collective Activity session.

    Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
    starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
    powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
    end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
    presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
    ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
    forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.

    The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.
