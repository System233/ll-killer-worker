    Sugar Learning Platform - matching game creation/playing activity
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning
    through Sugar Activities that encourage critical thinking,
    the heart of a quality education.
    Designed from the ground up especially for children,
    Sugar offers an alternative to traditional "office-desktop" software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.
    They are software packages that automatically save your work -
    producing specific instances of the Activity
    that can be resumed at a later time.
    Many Activities support learner collaboration,
    where multiple learners may be invited
    to join a collective Activity session.

    This package contains the Memorize activity.

    Memorize is about finding matching pairs.
    A pair can consist of any multimedia object.
    At the moment these are images,
    sounds and text but this could be extended
    to animations or movie snippets as well.
