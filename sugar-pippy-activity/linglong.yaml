    Sugar Learning Platform - Python programming activity
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
    Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
    education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
    offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
    packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
    instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
    Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
    be invited to join a collective Activity session.

    Pippy allows the student to examine, execute, and modify simple Python
    programs.  In addition it is possible to write Python statements to
    play sounds, calculate  expressions, or make simple text based
    interactive games.
