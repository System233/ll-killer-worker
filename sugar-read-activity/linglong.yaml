    Sugar Learning Platform - document viewer activity
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning
    through Sugar Activities that encourage critical thinking,
    the heart of a quality education.
    Designed from the ground up especially for children,
    Sugar offers an alternative to traditional "office-desktop" software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.
    They are software packages that automatically save your work -
    producing specific instances of the Activity
    that can be resumed at a later time.
    Many Activities support learner collaboration,
    where multiple learners may be invited
    to join a collective Activity session.

    The Read activity provides a document viewer
    that can display PDF, epub, djvu, and plain txt.
