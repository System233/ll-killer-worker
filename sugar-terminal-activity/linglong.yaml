    Sugar Learning Platform - terminal emulation activity
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
    Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
    education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
    offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
    packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
    instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
    Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
    be invited to join a collective Activity session.

    Terminal provides a Bash shell command line, with access to all of the
    usual cryptic Unix commands, which are generally considered beyond the
    capabilities of elementary-school children. However, there are always
    exceptions.
