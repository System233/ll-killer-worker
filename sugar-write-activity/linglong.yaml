    Sugar Learning Platform - writing activity
    Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
    Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
    education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
    offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.

    Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
    packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
    instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
    Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
    be invited to join a collective Activity session.

    The Write activity serves as a basic text editing application.  Its
    simple interface provides an easy starting point for children,
    presenting tools that make writing a story, poem or essay simple and
    straightforward.  It also supports basic tools for inserting images,
    creating tables, and performing basic layout operations as children
    begin to require some of these features often associated with word
    processors.
