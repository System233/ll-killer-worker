    fancy clock showing time and geographical data
    sunclock is an X11 application that displays a map of the Earth and
    indicates the illuminated portion of the globe by drawing sunlit
    areas dark on light, night areas as light on dark.  In addition to
    providing local time for the default timezone, it also displays GMT
    time, legal and solar time of major cities, their latitude and
    longitude, and the mutual distances of arbitrary locations on Earth.
    Sunclock can display meridians, parallels, tropics and arctic
    circles.  It has builtin functions that accelerate the speed of time
    and show the evolution of seasons.
