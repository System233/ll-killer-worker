    rendering system for photo-realistic image synthesis (GUI)
    Sunflow is an open source rendering system for photo-realistic image
    synthesis. It is written in Java and built around a flexible ray
    tracing core and an extensible object-oriented design. It was created
    as a framework for experimenting with global illumination algorithms
    and new surface shading models.

    This package contains the sunflow GUI.
