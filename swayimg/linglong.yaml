    image viewer for Sway/Wayland
    The program uses Sway IPC to determine the geometry of the currently focused
    container. This data is used to calculate the position and size of the new
    "overlay" window that will be used to draw the image. In the next step, swayimg
    adds two Sway rules for the self window: "floating enable" and "move position".
    Then it creates a new Wayland window and draws the image from the specified
    file.
