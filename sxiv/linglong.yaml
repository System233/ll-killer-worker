    simple X image viewer
    sxiv is an alternative to feh and qiv. Its only dependency besides xlib
    is imlib2. The primary goal for writing sxiv is to create an image
    viewer, which only has the most basic features required for fast image
    viewing. It works nicely with tiling window managers and its code base
    should be kept small and clean to make it easy for you to dig into it
    and customize it for your needs.
