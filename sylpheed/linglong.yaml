    Light weight e-mail client with GTK+
    Sylpheed is an e-mail client which aims for:
    * Quick response
    * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
    * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
    * Abundant features
    The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for
    Windows, such as Outlook Express or so.
    The interface is also designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost
    all commands are accessible with the keyboard.
