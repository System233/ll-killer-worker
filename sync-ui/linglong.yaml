    Sync personal information data via SyncML/CalDAV/CardDAV (GTK+ GUI)
    SyncEvolution synchronizes contact, calendar and task items via SyncML and
    CalDAV/CardDAV with other servers or devices. It uses the Evolution Data Server
    to sync PIM data in Evolution, but a plain file storage is also supported.
    Data exchange can happen via HTTP(S) and Bluetooth. Full, one-way and
    incremental synchronization of items are supported. SyncEvolution can act as
    a SyncML/DAV client and SyncML server.

    This package provides a GTK+ graphical user interface.
