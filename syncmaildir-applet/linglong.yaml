    mailbox synchronization tools - GNOME applet
    Sync Mail Dir is a set of utilities to synchronize a pair of mailboxes
    in Maildir format, using SSH to transfer data.

    This package provides an applet that integrates smd-loop with GNOME; that
    is, it notifies the user with popups, starts smd-loop when the user logs
    in, and provides a simple user interface to deal with synchronization
    errors.
