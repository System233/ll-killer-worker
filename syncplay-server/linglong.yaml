    To learn what Syncplay is read the description of package 'syncplay'.

    This package installs the Syncplay server program. Install this package when
    you plan to set up your own Syncplay server that your friends and family
    connect to.

    Note that the computer that runs the Syncplay server must be reachable from the
    Internet. To enable encryption, you need a domain and a valid certificate. The
    package provides a hook script for the recommended certbot package to simplify
    encrypted configurations. Integration with the suggested packages dehydrated
    or acme-tiny requires manual configuration.
