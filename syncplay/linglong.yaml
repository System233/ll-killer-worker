    Synchronize playback of various video players via internet (Client)
    Allows you to watch movies with friends or family at different places
    synchronized via the internet.

    When a viewer pauses/continues playback or seeks within their media player
    this will be replicated across all media players connected to the same server
    in the same viewing session. A chat function is included so viewers can
    discuss the movie while watching it. To improve the communication experience
    for viewers, the Syncplay developers and therefore the syncplay-client package
    suggest to use additional VoIP software (package mumble) or video phone
    software (packages jami or linphone-desktop).

    Technically, it synchronizes the position and play states of multiple mpv,
    VLC, MPC-HC and MPC-BEmedia player instances so viewers' players present the
    same movie at the same time.

    In case your friends and family do not use Debian, Syncplay is available for
    other operating systems on the upstream website.
    To learn what Syncplay is read the description of package 'syncplay'.

    This package installs the graphical desktop client program that does the actual
    synchronization of your video player. Therefore it must connect to a Syncplay
    server.
