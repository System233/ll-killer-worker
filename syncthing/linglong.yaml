    decentralized file synchronization
    Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across
    multiple devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files
    on one machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices.
    Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data
    across your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.

    This package contains the main binary: syncthing.
