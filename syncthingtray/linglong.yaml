    desktop integration for Syncthing
    Syncthing Tray is a user-friendly frontend for Syncthing.  The tray applet
    contains a dashboard and remote controls for Syncthing.

    This package makes Syncthing easier to use because it provides desktop
    integration; The familiarity of a desktop interface makes it easier to
    add shared folders and remote nodes, as well as to associate them with
    each other.  It also provides quick access to the Device ID QR code so
    that phones can be more easily added to the mesh network.

    Syncthing Tray is also typically used to enable, monitor, and control the
    Syncthing systemd service.  Finally, a program called "syncthingctl" is
    provided as an additional remote control; it may be useful in scripts.

    Syncthing is an application for decentralised file synchronisation and p2p
    folder sharing.  It is an alternative solution to Dropbox, Google Drive,
    and WebDav.  Syncthing also fulfills (or exceeds) the requirements for
    file synchronisation that users of iCloud, ownCloud, or Nextcloud expect.

    This package contains the tray applet, and syncthingctl.  Users of KDE
    Plasma will benefit from superior integration as well as addition features
    provided in the "syncthingtray-kde-plasma" package.
