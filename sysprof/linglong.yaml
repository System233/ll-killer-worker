    system-wide Linux profiler
    Sysprof is a sampling CPU profiler that uses a ptrace in Linux kernel to
    profile the entire system, not just a single application. Sysprof handles
    shared libraries and applications do not need to be recompiled. In fact they
    don't even have to be restarted.

    It has the following features:
    - profiles all running processes, not just a single application
    - has a simple graphical interface
    - shows the time spent in each branch of the call tree
    - profiles can be loaded and saved
