    graphical interface to configure the printing system
    System-config-printer is a GUI written in Python using GTK+ to
    configure a CUPS server. Its primary use is to configure the printing
    system on the local host, but can also be used to setup a remote
    printer.

    In terms of features, it aims to be as complete as the CUPS web
    administration tool, while being integrated to the desktop.
