    desktop bar extensible in Haskell
    This bar is based on gtk2hs and provides several widgets (including a few
    graphical ones).
    It also sports an optional snazzy system tray.

    This package comes pre-configured with the default configuration. If you want
    to build your custom-configured version, make sure that libghc-taffybar-dev is
    installed and put your configuration in ~/.config/taffybar/taffybar.hs
