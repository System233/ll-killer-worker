    Board-game frontend for playing chess variants and other games
    Tagua is a frontend for a variety of board games.  Currently
    supported games include chess, shogi and a couple of variants of
    those games.

    Tagua is based on a powerful plugin system that allows many games to
    share the same graphical framework, game history handling,
    interoperability with AI engines and connectivity to network servers.

    It currently has support for xboard-compatible chess engines, and
    xshogi-compatible shogi engines, as well as network play on chess ICS
    servers.
