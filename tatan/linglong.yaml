    pointing STG shooter game
    Tatan is a shooter game with simplified controls: use the mouse to aim and
    shoot, and the space bar to toggle your position. You have to collect the
    yellow stars (or shoot the white ones circumscribed in spheres) for
    power-ups.

    The game is played in some sort of quantum universe, and you are either
    positioned on the left or the right.
