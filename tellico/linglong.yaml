    Collection manager for books, videos, music, etc
    Tellico is a collection manager for KDE. It includes default collections for
    books, bibliographies, comic books, videos, music, coins, stamps, trading
    cards, and wines.

    Tellico capabilities include:

    * creation of user-defined custom collections with unlimited fields,
    * automatically formatted names,
    * sorting and filtering by any field or property,
    * ISBN validation,
    * full customization for printing or display through XSLT files,
    * import and export of CSV, RIS, BibTeX and BibTeXML files,
    * import data from Amazon, IMDb, CDDB or any US-MARC compliant z39.50 server.

    Tellico files are stored in XML format, avoiding the need for a database
    server, and allowing other software applications to use the data.
