    Bridge hand viewer and editor
    Tenace is a Bridge hand viewer and editor. Hand records are read using
    BBO's .lin format. The board editor allows one to easily move cards around to
    simulate different distributions. The double dummy solver computes optimal
    lines of play and par scores.

    Bridge is an intellectually challenging card game for four players.
