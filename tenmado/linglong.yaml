    hard-core shoot 'em up game in blue-or-red world
    tenmado is a vertically scrolling, late 1990s style (that is, a massive
    number of enemy shots against a smaller-than-it-looks spaceship) shoot 'em
    up game.  A very accurate collision detection makes it a game of
    dexterity.  If something looks like a triangle, it is a triangle, not
    a rectangle of similar size.

    However, surviving is only 20% of the game.  The main feature of tenmado
    is the "color chain bonus".  You can get a very big score (about 100 times
    bigger than a normal enemy-destruction point) by destroying enemies of
    the same color successively.  It is easy or difficult depending on how
    greedy you are.
