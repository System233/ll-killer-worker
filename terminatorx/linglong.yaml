    realtime audio synthesizer
    terminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to
    "scratch" on digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.mp3, etc.)
    the way hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple
    turntables, realtime effects (built-in as well as LADSPA plugin
    effects), a sequencer and an easy-to-use GTK+ GUI.
