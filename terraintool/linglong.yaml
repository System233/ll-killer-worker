  description: |-
    Generates survex/therion terrain models from SRTM/NASADEM data.
    This tool generates terrain meshes for cave survey tools from online
    terrain altitude datasets. It uses the NASA SRTM and later NASADEM
    datasets (The latter has the voids removed using ASTER data).
    The relevant data is downloaded and excerpted, geolocated to the desired
    co-ordinate system, resampled to a mesh grid, an offset to local grid
    added if required, the result displayed, and saved in survex (.svx)
    or therion (.th) format. It is written in java.
