    microphone into B-format signals ready for recording. Main features:

    * A-B conversion using a classic scalar matrix and minimum phase
    filters, or
    * A-B conversion using a 4 by 4 convolution matrix using measured
    or computed impulse responses, or a combination of both.
    * Individual microphone calibration facilities.
    * 24 dB/oct higpass filters.
    * Metering, monitoring and test facilities.
    * Virtual stereo mic for stereo monitoring or recording.
