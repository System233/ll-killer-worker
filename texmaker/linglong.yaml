    cross-platform LaTeX editor
    Texmaker is a clean, highly configurable LaTeX editor with good hot key
    support and extensive LaTeX documentation. Texmaker integrates many tools
    needed to develop documents with LaTeX, in just one application. It has
    some nice features such as syntax highlighting, insertion of 370 mathematical
    symbols with only one click, and "structure view" of the document for easier
    navigation.
