    text-based MU* and chatserver client
    TinyFugue is a text-based, line-based client designed for connecting to
    most flavors of MU* servers (TinyMUSH, TinyMUX, LP, Diku, etc.) or any
    telnet-based chatserver.  It includes support for 256-color terminals,
    MCCP versions 1 and 2, a powerful trigger and scripting language, and
    many other features.  Encryption of communications with SSL/TLS is
    supported, but not validation of certificates.  Unicode is not currently
    supported.

    This package is the current development version of TinyFugue (major
    version 5).  For the current stable version (major version 4), install
    the "tf" package instead.
