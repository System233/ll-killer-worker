    2D vector graphic drawing tool using Xlib
    Tgif (originally the "Tangram Graphic Interface Facility") is a
    classic drawing program for 2D vector graphics. Image objects can
    be hierarchically constructed out of primitives such as polygons,
    text, and splines (though the splines Tgif draws are not BÃ©zier
    curves).

    It natively supports PostScript formats suitable for LaTeX, as well
    as X11 bitmap or (version 1) pixmap formats. Other vector and raster
    image formats such as SVG and PNG can be handled via filters.

    Tgif stores drawings as .obj files and individual building-block
    objects as .sym files, both in Prolog-compatible fact file format.
