    Cave surveying - 2D and 3D drawing software
    Therion aids the process of drawing up cave surveys (maps). Drawings are
    done over scans and can be distorted to fit the centreline data. Output is
    in single sheet or atlas style PDF or SVG files. All data is stored in text
    files and a map editor (xtherion) is provided to aid in the creation of the
    files. A wide range of co-ordinate systems is supported.

    Therion can also produce 3D models, generated from walls and
    passage-heights.  Output formats supported are Survex .3d files, VRML, DXF,
    SVG, shapefiles, and the native .lox. Scanned map overlays and relief data
    can be incorporated into models. Therion is compatible with Survex, and
    centreline data can be stored in Survex or Therion form. If survex is
    installed it is used for loop closures. Centreline data and sketches can be
    imported from PocketTopo, allowing full paperless surveying.

    TeX and metapost are used to generate the images. libtk-img is needed to use
    scans in formats other than GIF and PNM (such as PNG and JPEG).
    Survex will be used for loop-closure if installed, but is not required.

    You will need appropriate TeX language packages to process therion files which
    specify those character sets: texlive-lang-czechslovak is needed to process
    the examples, and texlive-lang-cyrillic is also suggested. See README.Debian
    for details.
