    Python IDE for beginners
    Thonny is a simple Python IDE with features useful for learning programming.

    It comes with a debugger which is able to visualize all the conceptual steps
    taken to run a Python program (executing statements, evaluating expressions,
    maintaining the call stack). There is a GUI for installing 3rd party packages
    and special mode for learning about references.

    See the homepage for more information and screenshots.
