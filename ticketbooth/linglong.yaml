    Watchlist for movies and TV shows
    Ticket Booth is a graphical application meant for managing a watchlist for
    movies and TV shows. It helps one keep track of watched titles and be notified
    of new releases.

    This application can be used fully offline (relying on the user for entering
    the details of a new movie/series) or by fetching data from TMDB for easier
    usage.
