    Virtual network computing client for X
    VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote display
    system that allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment not only on
    the machine where it is running but from anywhere on the Internet and from a
    wide variety of machine architectures. For this purpose, it implements a
    client/server model.

    This package provides a VNC client for X. With this you can connect to a
    VNC server and display its content. There are VNC servers available for other
    operating systems.
