    GTK+ based drop down terminal for Linux and Unix
    Tilda is a terminal emulator similar to normal terminals like
    gnome-terminal (GNOME) or Konsole (KDE), with the difference
    that it drops down from the edge of a screen when a certain configurable
    hotkey is pressed. This is similar to the build-in consoles in
    games such as Quake or Half-live. Tilda is highly configureable
    through a graphical wizard.
