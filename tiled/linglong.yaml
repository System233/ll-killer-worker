    Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It's built to be easy to use,
    yet capable of catering to a host of varying game engines, whether your game
    is an RPG, platformer or Breakout clone. Tiled supports plugins to read and
    write map formats, in addition to its map format, to support map formats in
    use by engines.
