    Tiling terminal emulator for GNOME
    Tilix is a feature-rich tiling terminal emulator following the
    GNOME human interface design guidelines.
    Its many features include:

    * Layout terminals in any fashion by splitting them horizontally or
    vertically.
    * Terminals can be re-arranged using drag and drop both within and
    between windows.
    * Terminals can be detached into a new window via drag and drop.
    * Input can be synchronized between terminals so commands typed in
    one terminal are replicated to the others.
    * Supports notifications when processes are completed out of view.
