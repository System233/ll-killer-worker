    Tetris clone for text based terminal
    TINT Is Not Tetris(tm) ...at least the name isn't.

    As the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game
    written by Alexey Pajitnov, Dmitry Pavlovsky, and Vadim Gerasimov.

    The game is as close to the original as possible, but there are a few
    differences. Nevertheless, it's probably the closest to the original
    that you'll ever find in the UNIX world...
