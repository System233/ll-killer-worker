    lightweight taskbar
    Tint is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should
    also work with other window managers. The taskbar includes transparency and
    color settings for the font, icons, border, and background. It also supports
    multihead setups, customized mouse actions, and a built-in clock. Tint was
    originally based on ttm code. Since then, support has also been added
    for a battery monitor and system tray.

    The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with lightweight code and
    compliance with freedesktop specification.
