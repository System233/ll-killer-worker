    free open source touch typing software
    TIPP10 is a free touch typing tutor for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. The
    ingenious thing about the software is its intelligence feature.
    Characters that are mistyped are repeated more frequently. Beginners
    will find their way around right away so they can start practicing
    without a hitch.

    Useful support functions and an extensive progress tracker, topical
    lessons and the ability to create your own practice lessons make
    learning to type easy.
