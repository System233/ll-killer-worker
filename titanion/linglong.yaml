    Titanion is an abstract shooter game. While you fire with one button, the
    other one acts as a tractor ray to attract the enemies and take them to
    the combat line. The game in itself is quite simple, but with such
    graphics and playability that it's worth a try.

    Titanion is another gem among many by Kenta Cho.
