    Tcl/Tk Info browser
    TKInfo is a very fast lightweight viewer for GNU info files, requiring
    no configuration. It is particularly effective for local browsing of
    large and/or interconnected sets of info files.

    TkInfo can be used stand alone, or embedded within an application
    to provide integrated, on-line help.
