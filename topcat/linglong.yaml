    Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables
    TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular
    data. Its aim is to provide most of the facilities that astronomers
    need for analysis and manipulation of source catalogues and other
    tables, though it can be used for non-astronomical data as well. It
    understands a number of different astronomically important formats
    (including FITS and VOTable) and more formats can be added.

    This package contains the executable.
