    set of programs implementing The OpenMS Proteomic Pipeline
    TOPP (the OpenMS proteomic pipeline) is a pipeline for the analysis
    of HPLC/MS data. It consists of a set of numerous small applications
    that can be chained together to create analysis pipelines tailored
    for a specific problem. The applications make use of the libopenms
    library. Some examples of these applications are :

    - TOPPView: A viewer for mass spectrometry data.
    - TOPPAS: An assistant for GUI-driven TOPP workflow design.
    - DTAExtractor: Extracts spectra of an MS run file to several
    files in DTA format.
    - FileConverter:  Converts between different MS file formats.
    - FileFilter: Extracts or manipulates portions of data from peak,
    feature or consensus feature files.
    - SpectraMerger: Merges spectra from an LC/MS map, either by
    precursor or by RT blocks.
    - BaselineFilter: Removes the baseline from profile spectra using a
    top-hat filter.
    - InternalCalibration: Applies an internal calibration.
    - PTModel: Trains a model for the prediction of proteotypic
    peptides from a training set.
    - RTPredict: Predicts retention times for peptides using a model
    trained by RTModel.
    - ExecutePipeline: Executes workflows created by TOPPAS.
