    helps download and run the Tor Browser Bundle
    Tor Browser Launcher is intended to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) easier
    to maintain and use for GNU/Linux users. torbrowser-launcher handles
    downloading the most recent version of TBB for you, in your language and for
    your architecture. It also adds a "Tor Browser" application launcher to your
    operating system's menu.

    When you first launch Tor Browser Launcher, it will download TBB from
    https://www.torproject.org/ and extract it to ~/.local/share/torbrowser,
    and then execute it.
    Cache and configuration files will be stored in ~/.cache/torbrowser and
    ~/.config/torbrowser.
    Each subsequent execution after installation will simply launch the most
    recent TBB, which is updated using Tor Browser's own update feature.
