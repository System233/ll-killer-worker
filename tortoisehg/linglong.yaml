    Graphical tool for working with Mercurial
    TortoiseHg provides a graphical tool for interacting with the distributed
    revision control system Mercurial.  GUI support is provided for over a dozen
    operations, including add files, commit changes, manage ignore filter, view
    change log, merge, recover/rollback, edit configuration, synchronize
    repository, and many others.   The highlight is the interactive commit tool
    which allows easy selection of diffs from multiple files and packaging into
    changesets, and which is more powerful and easier to use than available
    alternatives such as qct and hgct (commit-tool).
