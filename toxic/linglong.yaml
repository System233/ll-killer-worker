    curses Tox based instant messenging client
    This is a Tox-based instant messenging client which formerly resided in
    the Tox core repository, and is now available as a standalone
    application.

    Tox is a secure and distributed Skype replacement.

    At its heart itâ€™s a client dealing with its core library communicating
    on its own protocol. All communications are encrypted using the peer
    audited NaCl cypto library and this encryption can not be turned off.

    Tox is powered by a distributed network which uses P2P connections for
    chats between people, unlike other Skype replacements no federated
    servers, centralized servers, or supernodes are used.
