    This is a launcher for people that are nostalgic about katapult
    Trabucco means trebuchet in Italian, which is a siege weapon, like a catapult.
    When KDE4 was released, katapult was replaced by krunner.

    Trabucco aims at providing an experience similar to katapult, using modern
    freedesktop.org standards.

    It shows only one action per search query, and it is very deterministic about
    it.

    It is much faster than krunner.
