    OpenGL-based game of steering a marble through a labyrinth
    Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness
    on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth
    filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the
    player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues
    at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out.

    This game is not intended to be a replica of Marble Madness but rather
    inspired by it. The game is also highly configurable by using a
    scripting extension (Guile) and it provides a simple editor by which new
    levels can easily be created.
