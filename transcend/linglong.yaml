    retro-style, abstract 2D shooter
    Transcend can best be described as retro-style, abstract 2-D shooter. The
    graphics are geometrical, and the pace is sometimes frenzied.

    Two features set Transcend apart from other games. First, its dynamic
    graphical engine, which can smoothly morph from one complex shape to
    another, produces striking displays. Combining these dynamic shapes with
    subtle randomizations makes each play through a Transcend level visually
    different from the last. The second novel feature is Transcend's musical
    power-up system. As you play through a level, you are simultaneously
    assembling an abstract visual collage and arranging a unique piece of
    music. Transcend merges video games with pure art---it can be viewed either
    as a game or as a multimedia sculpture.
