    versatile tree-like structured custom data manager
    TreeLine is a versatile tool for working with all kind of information
    that fits into a tree-like structure.

    It can be used to edit bookmark files, create mini-databases (e.g., for
    addresses, tasks, records, CDs, etc.), outline documents, or just
    collect ideas. It can also be used as a generic editor for XML files.

    The data schemas for any node in the data tree can be customized and
    new types of nodes can be defined. The way data is presented on the
    screen, exported to HTML, or printed can be defined with HTML-like
    templates. Plug-ins can be written to load and save data from and to
    custom file formats or external data sources and extend the
    functionality of TreeLine.
