    Data organizer that covers spreadsheets, mind mappers, and small databases
    Suitable for any kind of data organization, such as Todo lists, calendars,
    project management, brainstorming, organizing ideas, planning, requirements
    gathering, presentation of information, etc.

    It shares many characteristics with more familiar tools, and augments their
    abilities - like a spreadsheet, but supporting hierarchical data; like a mind
    mapper, but more organized and compact; like an outliner, but in more than one
    dimension; and like a text editor, but with structure.
