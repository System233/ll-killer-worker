    Displays and prints phylogenetic trees
    TreeView X is an open source and multi-platform program to display
    phylogenetic trees. It can read and display NEXUS and Newick format tree files
    (such as those output by PAUP*, ClustalX, TREE-PUZZLE, and other programs). It
    allows one to order the branches of the trees, and to export the trees in SVG
    format.
