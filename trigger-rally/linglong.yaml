    3D rally car racing game
    Trigger is a free 3D rally car racing game. Fun for all the family!

    Trigger comes with a number of challenges where you have to race several
    tracks to finish each challenge.

    When racing a track, you have to reach several locations marked by pulsating
    rings in sequence. To win a race you have to reach the last location in time.

    Trigger is highly customisable, and it's easy to add new levels and vehicles.

    An OpenGL accelerated video card is required to play Trigger.
