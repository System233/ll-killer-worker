    sticky 2D shooter
    Tumiki Fighters brings a different twist to the side-scrolling shooter genre.
    With simple 3D graphics, the player has to control a ship and shoot down the
    enemies. The player can swoop in and attach the wreckage to its own hull for
    bonus points and protection from enemy attacks. .

    Tumiki Fighters is another gem among many by Kenta Cho.
