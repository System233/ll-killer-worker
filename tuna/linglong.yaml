    Low-level system performance tuning for realtime systems
    Tuna is used to change the attributes of application and kernel threads, IRQs,
    CPUs, and CPU sockets. It can change scheduling policy, scheduler priority and
    processor affinity for processes and process threads. It can also change the
    processor affinity for interrupts, isolate CPUs, and spread threads or IRQs
    across CPUs.
