    tracker style MIDI sequencer
    This is a MIDI sequencer, songs are made of blocks. Each block
    represents a period in time. These blocks can be played in any order
    to form a complete song. Blocks are made of tracks on which the notes
    are placed. All tracks of a block are played simultaneously. Only
    one note can be played on one track at a time. Blocks can vary in
    length and may have different number of tracks.

    Each note is played using an instrument. Each instrument can have
    properties such as name, MIDI channel, default volume, hold time and
    so on. Effects can also be applied to notes. In Tutka effects include
    things like volume, aftertouch, pitch bending, note delays, setting
    tempo and so on. MIDI controllers can also be used.

    It uses a custom XML based file format for storing songs. Songs in
    OctaMED SoundStudio's MMD2 file format can also be loaded and saved.
