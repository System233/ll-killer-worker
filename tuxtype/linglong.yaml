    Educational Typing Tutor Game Starring Tux
    TuxTyping is an educational typing tutorial game starring
    Tux, the Linux Penguin. The player guides Tux to eat fish
    which are falling from the top of the screen. Each fish has a
    letter written on it. When the player presses the
    corresponding key, Tux will position himself to eat the fish.
    The game is intended for children learning to type, though it
    does have higher difficulty levels which even experienced
    typists may find challenging.
