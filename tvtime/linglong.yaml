    analog television display application
    This package provides a high quality analog television application
    for use video capture cards. It processes the input from a capture
    card and displays it on a computer monitor or projector.

    second for NTSC sources, or 50 frames per second for PAL sources.
    This gives smoothness of motion and high visual quality;
    * multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for
    the video content and available processor speed;
    * 16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
    processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
    receiver;
    * super-slick on-screen-display for the complete television
    experience, with a featureful menu system;
    * "2:3 pulldown" detection for optimal quality viewing of film content
    from NTSC sources.

    Digital television (DVB, ATSC, ISDB, DTMB) is not supported.
