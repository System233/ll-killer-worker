    World clock for ham radio operators
    It also has an ID timer to generate a CW ID via your soundcard and
    pulseaudio.  Connect the output of your soundcard to the audio-in pin
    of your rig's accessory jack to have it transmitted.

    This program is a clock designed for ham radio operators, anyone who
    needs the time of day someplace else in the world, or anyone tired of
    the same old look of their clock.  It can display the current time and
    date in hundreds of cities around the world.
