    UFO: Alien Invasion -- build your team and stop the aliens
    UFO: Alien Invasion is a squad-based tactical strategy game in the tradition
    of the old X-COM PC games. It combines military realism with hard
    science-fiction and the weirdness of an alien invasion. The carefully
    constructed turn-based system gives you pin-point control of your squad while
    maintaining a sense of pace and danger.

    UFO:AI has two main modes of play: Geoscape mode and Tactical mode.

    In Geoscape mode you manage the activities and finances of PHALANX, a secret
    organisation charged with defending Earth from a brutal alien enemy. You
    control bases, installations, aircraft and squads of armed-response troops.
    You will research new technologies and use their results in battle against the
    aliens. You can build, buy and produce anything you like, as long as your
    technology level and your budget will allow it. Easy-to-use time buttons make
    it possible to control the passage of time.

    In Tactical mode the game is about taking command of your team in various
    missions to combat the aliens wherever they might appear. Tactical mode uses a
    turn-based system, where your team and the aliens take turns to make moves.
    You can order your troops around, fire their weapons, throw grenades and use
    other equipment. All actions require Time Units to perform. Once a soldier is
    out of Time Units, he or she can't do anything more until the next turn. Your
    mission objectives will vary for each mission and there are many to perform as
    the aliens' terrifying plot unfolds. You'll have to watch your back, be quick
    on your feet and take the fight to them.

    If you don't, humanity is doomed.
