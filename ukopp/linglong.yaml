    Full and incremental backup to disk or disk-like device
    Ukopp is used to copy or back-up disk files to a disk or disk-like device,
    such as a USB stick. It copies only new or modified files since the last
    backup, and is therefore quite fast. A GUI is used to navigate the file
    system to include or exclude files or directories at any level. These
    choices can be saved in a job file for repeated use. New files appearing
    within the included directories are handled automatically. Optionally,
    previous versions of the backup files can be retained instead of being
    overwritten. Files can be selectively restored using a GUI. Ownership
    and permissions are also restored, even if the target device uses a
    Microsoft file system.
