    lightweight GTK+ window manager
    Ukwm is a small window manager, using GTK+ and Clutter to do
    everything.

    Ukwm is the clutter-based evolution of Metacity, which, as the
    author says, is a "Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many
    window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like
    Cheerios."

    This package contains the core binaries.
