    Virtual machine simulator based around the MIPS R2/3000 microprocessor
    µMPS is an educational computer system architecture and an accompanying
    emulator designed from the ground up to achieve the right trade-off between
    simplicity and elegance on one side, and realism on the other. This makes µMPS
    ideally suited for use in education, such as hands-on operating systems or
    computer architecture university courses.

    The µMPS processor implements the MIPS I instruction set, and can therefore be
    supported out of the box by existing MIPS compilers. The architecture details
    a complete set of I/O devices (terminals, disks, flash devices, printers, and
    network adapters) that feature a clean, consistent, programming interface.
    The previous revision of the µMPS architecture (µMPS2) brings multiprocessor
    support.

    The emulator comes with built-in debugging features and an easy to use
    graphical user interface. Apart from the emulator itself, several support
    utilities are provided that can get you quickly started in developing programs
    for µMPS.
