    file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows with GTK+ interface
    Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows, written
    in OCaml. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and
    directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks
    on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to
    date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

    Unison offers several advantages over various synchronization methods
    such as CVS, Coda, rsync, Intellisync, etc. Unison can run on and
    synchronize between Windows and many UNIX platforms. Unison requires
    no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison
    can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions,
    on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct
    socket connection.

    Transfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol,
    making it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise
    specification, and is resilient to failure due to its careful
    handling of the replicas and its private structures.

    This package adds the optional GTK+ interface.
