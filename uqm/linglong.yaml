    The Ur-Quan Masters - An inter-galactic adventure game
    You return to Earth with a vessel built from technology discovered from an
    ancient race called the Precursors only to find it enslaved. Gather allies
    from a wide variety of races, engage in space combat with various foes, and
    save the galaxy from the Ur-Quan!

    The Ur-Quan Masters is derived from the classic game Star Control II.
    It includes both the adventure game described above and a fast-paced
    Super Melee.
