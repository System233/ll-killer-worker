    create a startup disk using a CD or disc image (for GNOME)
    Startup Disk Creator converts a USB key or SD card into a volume from which you
    can start up and run Ubuntu. You can also store files and settings in any space
    left over.

    The program also works for Debian, or any other Debian-based OS for which you
    have a CD or .iso image.

    This package contains the GTK+ client frontend.
