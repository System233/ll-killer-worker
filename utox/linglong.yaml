    lightest and fluffiest Tox client
    µTox is the lightweight client with minimal dependencies; it not only looks
    pretty, it runs fast! µTox is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux (Android
    support is experimental), with full support for chat, file transfers,
    audio/video calling, and desktop sharing (both as video and inline
    screenshots). It also supports text group chats with audio groups pending the
    next Toxcore update.
