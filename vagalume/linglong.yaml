    GTK+-based client for Last.fm-compatible radio services
    Vagalume is a Last.fm client designed for the GNOME desktop
    environment. It's small and provides the basic Last.fm features, such
    as scrobbling, tags, recommendations, etc.

    Although Last.fm itself stopped providing its radio service in 2014,
    Vagalume can be used with other Last.fm-compatible services such as
    Libre.fm.
