    pattern making program
    Valentina is a pattern drafting software tool
    for small-batch and custom-sized clothing manufacturing.

    Valentina allows designers to create and model patterns of clothing,
    using either standard sizing tables
    or an individualâ€™s set of measurements.
    It blends new technologies with traditional methods
    to create a unique pattern making tool.

    The "tape" executable is provided as "valentina-tape",
    and the "puzzle" executable is provided as "valentina-puzzle".
