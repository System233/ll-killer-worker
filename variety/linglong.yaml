    Wallpaper changer, downloader and manager
    Variety is a wallpaper manager for Linux systems. It supports numerous
    desktops and wallpaper sources, including local files and online
    services: Flickr, Wallhaven, Unsplash, and more.

    Where supported, Variety sits as a tray icon to allow easy pausing and
    resuming. Otherwise, its desktop entry menu provides a similar set of
    options.

    You can also install the following (suggested) packages to enhance Variety's
    functionality on certain desktop setups:
    * feh | nitrogen: used for wallpaper changing on i3, openbox, and dwm
    * gnome-shell-extension-appindicator | gnome-shell-extension-top-icons-plus:
    adds tray icon / indicator support to GNOME Shell, so that Variety's tray
    icon can be displayed
