    "Vectoroids" is a vector-based rock-shooting game similar to the
    arcade classic "Asteroids."
    Pilot a spaceship and destroy asteroids by shooting them into smaller and
    smaller pieces while trying to avoid being smashed or shot by UFOs.

    "Vectoroids" is an SDL game based on the source for
    "Agendaroids," an X-Window game written for the Agenda VR3 Linux-based PDA
    written by the same author.
