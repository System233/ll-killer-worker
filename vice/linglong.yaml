    Versatile Commodore Emulator
    VICE emulates well the hardware of the Commodore Business Machines of
    the pre-Amiga era. Supported are the various Pets, the VIC-20, the
    Commodore 64, the Commodore 128, the CBM-II series, and the PLUS/4.

    Some alternate keywords for the above: VIC20, C64, C=64, C64 DTV, C128,
    C=128, CBM-500, CBM-600, CBM-700, PLUS4 .

    This package does not contain the various ROM images needed to
    actually use the emulators; they are available separately from other
    locations (see the README.ROMs file).  A corporation in the
    Netherlands called Tulip holds the copyrights to the ROM images, and
    redistribution is not permitted, but VICE itself is unencumbered.
