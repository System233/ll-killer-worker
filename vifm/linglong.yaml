    flexible vi-like file manager using ncurses
    Vifm is a file manager providing a vi-like usage experience. It has similar
    keybindings and modes (e.g. normal, command line, visual). The interface uses
    ncurses, thus vifm can be used in text-only environments.
    It supports a wide range of features, some of which are known from the
    vi-editor:
    - utf8 support
    - user mappings (almost like in vi)
    - ranges in command-line commands
    - user defined commands (with support for ranges)
    - registers
    - operation undoing/redoing
    - fuse file systems support
    - trash
    - multiple files renaming
    - support of filename modifiers
    - colorschemes support
    - file name color according to file type
    - path specific colorscheme customization
    - bookmarks
    - operation backgrounding
    - customizable file viewers
    - handy less-like preview mode
    - filtering out and searching for files using regular expressions
    - one or two panes view
    With the package comes a plugin to use vifm as a vim file selector.
