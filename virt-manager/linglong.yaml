    desktop application for managing virtual machines
    The virt-manager application is a desktop user interface for managing virtual
    machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen
    and LXC (Linux containers). It presents a summary view of running domains,
    their live performance & resource utilization statistics. Wizards enable the
    creation of new domains, and configuration & adjustment of a domain's resource
    allocation & virtual hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer
    presents a full graphical console to the guest domain.
