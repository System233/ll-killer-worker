    Cross-platform Atari Jaguar emulator
    Virtual Jaguar is a cross-platform emulator for Atari's infamous
    Jaguar console, the last video game system to be ever released by
    the now defunct company. The Jaguar was marketed as the first
    64-bit video game system despite the fact that it was actually
    a 32-bit system at heart, just the blitter operated in 64-bit
    mode. The system was a commercial failure and eventually lead
    to Atari leaving the market for video game systems for good.

    This emulator features an intuitive user interface and emulation
    of all of the major subsystems of the Atari Jaguar console. This
    includes full GPU and DSP emulation as well as emulation of the
    Atari Jaguar CD. Most of the commercial Atari games are supported,
    albeit some of them have some minor glitches when running in the
    emulator.
