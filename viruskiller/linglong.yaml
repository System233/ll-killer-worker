    Game about viruses invading your computer
    Your computer has been invaded! Dozens of little viruses are pouring in via
    security holes in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft
    MSN Messenger and Microsoft Recycle Bin! Using your trusty mouse you must
    shoot the buggers before they can destroy your files! Some will steal them
    from their home directories and take them back to their security hole. Others
    will just eat them right there on the spot! See how long you and your computer
    can survive the onslaught!
