    tool for engraving PCBs using CNCs
    Visolate reads the gerber files describing printed circuit boards and converts
    them into the G-code (RS-274 code) needed to engrave the layout into a board
    using a CNC machine. Precise renditions of the original layout can be created
    as well as voronoi fillings of the original layout, shortening the toolpath.
