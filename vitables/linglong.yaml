    graphical tool to browse and edit PyTables and HDF5 files
    ViTables is a component of the PyTables family. It is a graphical
    tool for browsing and editing files in both PyTables and HDF5
    formats.

    ViTables capabilities include easy navigation through the data
    hierarchy, displaying of real data and its associated metadata, a
    simple, yet powerful, browsing of multidimensional data and much
    more.

    One of the greatest strengths of ViTables is its ability to display
    very large tables. Tables with one thousand millions of rows (and
    beyond) are navigated stunningly fast and with very low memory
    requirements. So, if you ever need to browse very large tables, don't
    hesitate, ViTables is your choice.
