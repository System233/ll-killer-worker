    Efficient visual trace explorer
    ViTE is a powerful portable and open source profiling tool to visualize
    the behaviour of parallel applications. Thanks to its scalable design,
    ViTE helps programmers to efficiently analyze the performance of
    potentially large applications.

    ViTE currently enables the visualisation of traces using the Paj√© format
    (open format, see http://www-id.imag.fr/Logiciels/paje/) and has various
    functionalities such as exporting a view in a svg format to integrate
    the results easily in a report, or viewing statistics.
