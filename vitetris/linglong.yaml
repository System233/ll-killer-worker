    Virtual terminal *tris clone
    Vitetris is a terminal-based Tetris game. It can be played by one or two
    players, over the network or on the same keyboard.

    Vitetris comes with more features and options than might be expected from
    a simple text mode game. Full input control, customizable appearance,
    netplay where both players can choose difficulty (level and height) --
    unless you must have sound (or just don't like Tetris), you won't be
    disappointed.

    Rotation, scoring, levels and speed should resemble the early Tetris games
    by Nintendo, with the addition of a short lock delay which makes it
    possible to play at higher levels. (It does not make it possible to
    prevent the piece from ever locking by abusing lock delay resets.)
