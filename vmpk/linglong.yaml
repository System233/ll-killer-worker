    Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard
    Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard is a MIDI events generator and
    receiver. It doesn't produce any sound by itself, but can be used to
    drive a MIDI synthesizer (either hardware or software, internal or
    external). You can use the computer's keyboard to play MIDI notes,
    and also the mouse. You can use the Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard to
    display the played MIDI notes from another instrument or MIDI file
    player.
