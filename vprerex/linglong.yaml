    Qt interface to prerex, a course prerequisite chart editor
    vprerex provides a Qt interface to prerex by integrating the prerex editor
    with a PDF viewer. This allows conveying coordinates of course boxes, arrows
    and background points back to prerex through the use of the clipboard.

    prerex is an editor for creating esthetically pleasing course prerequisite
    charts using the TikZ LaTeX package.

    Course prerequisite charts allow students to easily determine which
    prerequisites, corequisites and recommended prerequisites they need for a
    given course and their time slots. Course prerequisite charts also highlight
    the courses required by a degree.

    prerex is used by departments in several universities, including Queen's
    University and Suffolk University.
