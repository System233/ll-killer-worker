    Visual Voicemail Player
    Visual Voicemail Player is a GUI app that plays and deletes Visual voicemails
    retrieved by Visual Voicemail Daemon (vvmd).

    Visual voicemail is direct-access voicemail with a visual interface.
    Such an interface presents a list of messages for playback,
    as opposed to the sequential listening required using traditional voicemail,
    and may include a transcript of each message.
