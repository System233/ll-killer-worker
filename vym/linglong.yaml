    mindmapping tool
    Vym is a mind mapping program. It is useful to organize thoughts and
    do structure work. In addition to that it has a lot of helpful
    shortcuts.

    A mindmap is a multicolored and image centered radial diagram that
    represents semantic or other connections between portions of learned
    material.  For example, it can graphically illustrate the structure
    of a thesis outline, a project plan, or the government institutions
    in a state.  Mindmaps have many applications in personal, family,
    educational, and business situations.  Possibilities include
    note-taking, brainstorming, summarizing, revising and general
    clarifying of thoughts.
