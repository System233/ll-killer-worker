    programming environment for creating Doom maps
    WadC (Wad Compiler) is an Integrated Development Environment and
    functional programming language for developing Doom-engine maps.
    It can be used to generate complex levels which can be saved in
    Doom's WAD format.

    The IDE includes a text-editor component; a debug output
    pane and a 2D drawing pane which previews the current
    script's output. Also included is an experimental command line
    interface, wadccli.

    An external nodes builder (such as zdbsp) is required before
    the resulting WAD file can be played by a doom-engine.
