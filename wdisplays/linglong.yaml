    graphical application for configuring displays in Wayland compositors
    wdisplays is a graphical application for configuring displays in Wayland
    compositors. It borrows some code from kanshi. It should work in any compositor
    that implements the wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 protocol, including sway.
    The goal of this project is to allow precise adjustment of display settings in
    kiosks, digital signage, and other elaborate multi-monitor setups.
