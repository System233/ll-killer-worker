    Copy websites to your computer, httrack with a Web interface
    WebHTTrack is an offline browser utility, allowing you to download a World
    Wide website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively
    all directories, getting html, images, and other files from the server to
    your computer, using a step-by-step web interface.

    WebHTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply
    open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can
    browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online.
    HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume
    interrupted downloads. WebHTTrack is fully configurable, and has an
    integrated help system.
