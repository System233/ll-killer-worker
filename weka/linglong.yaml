    Machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks
    Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms in Java that can
    either be used from the command-line, or called from your own Java
    code. Weka is also ideally suited for developing new machine learning
    schemes.

    Implemented schemes cover decision tree inducers, rule learners, model
    tree generators, support vector machines, locally weighted regression,
    instance-based learning, bagging, boosting, and stacking. Also included
    are clustering methods, and an association rule learner. Apart from
    actual learning schemes, Weka also contains a large variety of tools
    that can be used for pre-processing datasets.

    This package contains the binaries and examples.
