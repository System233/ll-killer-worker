    simple tool to work around common problems in Wine
    Winetricks lets you install missing DLLs or tweak various Wine settings
    individually.  It also has a menu of supported games/apps for which it
    can do all the workarounds automatically.

    It can be used via GUI or commandline, whichever you prefer; the
    commandline mode is particularly useful as a building block in fancier
    wine frontends and in automated regression testing.
