    graphical video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg or avconv
    WinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg or avconv. It will convert
    almost any video file that FFmpeg or avconv will convert. WinFF does multiple
    files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert
    mpeg's, flv's, and mov's into avi's (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp
    etc.) all at once.

    WinFF provides a variety of preset conversion settings for
    common formats and devices. These presets are intended to hit the
    "sweet spot" for each individual codec. They have been written with a
    tip of the balance to quality.

    For most presets to work, it is necessary to have the unstripped version
    of the libavcodec package, which can be obtained by installing
    libavcodec-extra as recommended by the WinFF suite.
