    Nendo-inspired 3D polygon mesh modeller
    Wings 3D is a polygon mesh modeller written entirely in Erlang.  The
    user interface was designed to be easy to use for both beginners and
    advanced users alike.  It was inspired by the famous Nendo modeller
    (from Izware.)

    Unlike similar modelling programs (such as Blender), this program
    does not provide native support for doing animations (though you can
    output its models to an animation tool.)

    Wings 3D supports the following import formats: Nendo (NDO),
    3D Studio (3DS), Wavefront (OBJ), and Adobe Illustrator 8 (AI).

    Wings 3D supports the following export formats: Nendo (NDO),
    3D Studio (3DS), Wavefront (OBJ), VRML (WRL), Renderman (RIB),
    Hash:Animation Master (MDL), Renderware (RWX), Yafray, Toxic,
    and FBX via a third-party plug-in.

    Open Source Erlang is a functional programming language designed at
    the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory.
