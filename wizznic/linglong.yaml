    implementation of the arcade classic Puzznic
    As in the original game your mission is to clear the level of
    bricks. This is done by moving the bricks around. When two or
    more bricks of the same kind are next to each other or on top
    of each other they will disappear and points will be given.
    The level has to be clear of bricks before the time runs out
    or you will lose a life.
