    Window Maker dockapp for monitoring network traffic
    wmifs is a dockable applet for X11 that can monitor all your network
    interfaces. It's designed for Window Maker's Dock and AfterStep's Wharf,
    but it's not dependent on these window managers and should work with any
    other.

    WMiFS stands for "Window Maker InterFace Statistics".
