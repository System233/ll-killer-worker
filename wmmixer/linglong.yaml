    mixer application designed for WindowMaker
    wmmixer displays the mixer status of your computer in a small icon.
    Most common channels are identified with an appropriate icon. Control
    include a stereo (mono where appropriate) volume control and a recording
    source toggle button.

    It is possible to change between the different channels using two small
    buttons (previous channel, next channel) and to change the volume of the
    channel.

    There's nothing in the program that makes it require WindowMaker, except maybe
    the NeXTStep look and the fact that it properly docks. It can be used with
    other window managers without problems.
