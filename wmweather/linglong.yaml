    WindowMaker dockapp that shows your current weather
    wmweather provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that displays the current
    weather. The weather reports are received from NOAA's National Weather
    Service at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/, that is the same source that pilots use.

    wmweather is designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work with
    other window managers as well. xbase-clients are required for the left click
    to bring up the complete METAR record.
