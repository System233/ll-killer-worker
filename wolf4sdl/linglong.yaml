    SDL-Port of Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny
    Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
    sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of
    Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
    creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
    Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to
    shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.

    Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter
    Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia
    Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel
    while taking advantage of some improvements.

    The wolf4sdl game requires additional data files which are not available
    under a free license and cannot be distributed by Debian. Thus, this package
    contains no data files, but current releases of `game-data-packager' are
    able to generate suitable data packages from the publicly available
    Wolfenstein 3-D shareware episode.
