    continuation of the Boom/MBF bloodline of Doom source ports
    Woof! is a continuation of Lee Killough's Doom source port MBF
    targeted at modern systems.

    MBF stands for "Marine's Best Friend" and is widely regarded as the
    successor of the Boom source port by TeamTNT. It serves as the code
    base for popular Doom source ports such as PrBoom+/DSDA-Doom or The
    Eternity Engine. As the original engine was limited to run only under
    MS-DOS, it has been ported to Windows by Team Eternity under the name
    WinMBF in 2004. Woof! is developed based on the WinMBF code with the
    aim to make MBF more widely available and convenient to use on modern
    systems.

    To achieve this goal, this source port is less strict regarding its
    faithfulness to the original MBF. It is focused on quality-of-life
    enhancements, bug fixes and compatibility improvements. However, all
    changes have been introduced in good faith that they are in line with
    the original author's intentions and even for the trained eye, this
    source port should still look very familiar to the original MBF.

    In summary, this project's goal is to forward-port MBF.EXE from DOS to
    21st century and remove all the stumbling blocks on the way.
    Furthermore, just as MBF was ahead of its time, this project dedicates
    itself to early adoption of new modding features such as
    DEHEXTRA+DSDHacked, UMAPINFO and MBF21.
