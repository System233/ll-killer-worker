  description: |-
    electronic lexical database of English language (GUI)
    WordNet(C) is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is
    inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
    memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized
    into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical
    concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.

    WordNet was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton
    University under the direction of Professor George A. Miller (Principal
    Investigator).

    WordNet is considered to be the most important resource available to
    researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many
    related areas.

    This package contains a Tcl/Tk Gui to browse wordnet dictionary.
