    retro-styled side-scrolling shoot'em up arcade game
    Word War vi is your basic side-scrolling shoot 'em up '80s style arcade
    game. You pilot your "vi"per craft through core memory, rescuing lost .swp
    files, avoiding OS defenses, and wiping out those memory hogging emacs
    processes.

    Includes support for joysticks with force-feedback.
