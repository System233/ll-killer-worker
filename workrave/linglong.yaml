    Repetitive Strain Injury prevention tool
    Workrave is a program that assists in the recovery and prevention of
    Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). The program frequently alerts you to
    take micro-pauses, rest breaks and restricts you to your daily limit.

    It includes a system tray applet that works with GNOME and KDE
    and has network capabilities to monitor your activity even if
    switching back and forth between different computers is part of your
    job.

    Workrave offers many more configuration options than other similar
    tools.
