    Weak-signal amateur radio communications
    WSJT-X implements amateur radio communication protocols or "modes" called
    FST4, FST4W, FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one
    called Echo for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from
    the Moon.  These modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs
    under extreme weak-signal conditions.

    JT4, JT9, and JT65 use nearly identical message structure and source encoding
    (the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They
    use timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC.  JT4 and JT65 were
    designed for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands.  JT9 is
    optimized for the MF, and HF bands.  It  is about 2 dB more sensitive than
    JT65 while using less than 10% of the bandwidth.  Q65 offers submodes with a
    wide range of T/R sequence lengths and tone spacings.

    FT4 and FT8 are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and  15 s
    long, respectively.  MSK144 is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.
    These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard
    callsigns and some popular contests.

    FST4 and FST4W are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these
    bands their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with
    the same sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates
    of information throughput. FST4 is optimized for two-way QSOs, while FST4W is
    for quasi-beacon transmissions of WSPR-style messages. FST4 and FST4W do not
    require the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of
    modes like EbNaut.

    WSPR mode implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation
    paths with low-power transmissions. WSPR is fully implemented within WSJT-X,
    including programmable "band-hopping".
