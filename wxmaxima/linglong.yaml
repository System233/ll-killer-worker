    GUI for the computer algebra system Maxima
    wxMaxima is a graphical user interface for the computer algebra system
    Maxima. It eases the use of Maxima by making most of its commands available
    through a menu system and by providing input dialogs for commands that
    require more than one argument. It also implements its own display engine
    that outputs mathematical symbols directly instead of depicting them with
    ASCII characters.

    wxMaxima also features 2D and 3D inline plots, simple animations, mixing of
    text and mathematical calculations to create documents, exporting of input
    and output to TeX, and a browser for Maxima's manual including command index
    and full text searching.
