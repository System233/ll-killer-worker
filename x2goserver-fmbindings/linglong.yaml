    X2Go Server (file manager bindings)
    X2Go is a server based computing environment with
    - session resuming
    - low bandwidth support
    - session brokerage support
    - client-side mass storage mounting support
    - client-side printing support
    - audio support
    - authentication by smartcard and USB stick

    x2goserver-fmbindings contains generic MIME type information for X2Go's
    local folder sharing. It can be used with all freedesktop.org compliant
    desktop shells.

    However, this package will be superseded by other, more specific destkop
    binding components, if installed and being used with the corresponding
    desktop shell:

    - under LXDE by x2golxdebindings
    - under GNOMEv2 by x2gognomebindings
    - under MATE by x2gomatebindings
    - under KDE4/5 by plasma-widget-x2go
