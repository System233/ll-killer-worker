    simulation of the ancient calculator (plain X version)
    This program is an implementation of the original abacus, it provides
    the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Roman and Russian version and can be
    modified to allow others.

    This version was compiled without the Motif GUI widget library and thus
    shows limited user interface functionality. See xmabacus for the
    extended version.
