    real-time interactive fractal zoomer
    XaoS allows you to zoom and pan around a fractal in
    real time. It can display the animated fractals in graphical
    or even plain text mode.

    It displays the Mandelbrot set or many other fractals and
    allows you to zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring
    modes are provided for both the points inside and outside the
    selected set. In addition, switching between Mandelbrot and Julia
    fractal types is provided.

    Other features include autopilot mode, palette changing,
    image saving, fractal inversion, filters, and a built in fractal
    tutorial.
