    GTK+ frontend for most used compression formats
    Xarchiver is a lightweight desktop independent GTK+ frontend for handling 7z,
    apk, arj, bzip, bzip2, bzip3, cab, cb7, cbr, cbt, cbz, chm, compress, cpio,
    docx, epub, fbz, gzip, iso, jar, jsonlz4, lha, lrzip, lz4, lzip, lzma, lzop,
    mozlz4, odt, oxt, rar, rpm, rzip, snap, squashfs, tar, xpi, xz, zip, zpaq,
    zstd and ar files including the deb format and self-extracting exe files, if
    they were internally compressed with either 7zip, arj, lha, rar or zip.
    Multi-threading tools such as lbzip2, pbzip2, pigz and plzip can be used as
    replacements for their respective counterparts.

    Xarchiver allows you to list, test and create archives, add and copy files to
    them, extract, delete, cut and drag files from them, edit files in them, and
    paste and drop files into them. Password protected 7z, arj, lrzip, rar and
    zip archives are supported.
