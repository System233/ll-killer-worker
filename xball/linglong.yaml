    Simulate bouncing balls in a window
    A simple educational game that simulates bouncing balls in a window. Gravity,
    elasticity, and ability to collide can all be adjusted.

    Young children enjoy watching the balls bounce around the screen and are
    fascinated by the program. This is an ideal program for teaching rudimentary
    mouse skills to very young children.
