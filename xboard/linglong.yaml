    X Window System Chess Board
    XBoard is a graphical chessboard that can serve as a user interface
    for chess programs, for the Internet Chess Server, or for electronic
    mail correspondence chess. It supports all major forms of chess,
    such as international chess, xiangqi and shogi. XBoard can also be
    used by itself as viewer for stored chess games.

    XBoard uses the Helvetica font (located in the xfonts-75dpi and
    xfonts-100dpi packages) by default.  However, other fonts can be
    specified via a command line option or an X resource.
