    x509 Certification Authority management tool based on QT
    XCA creates and manages Certificate authorities and helps the user to
    create and manage keys, certificates, certificate sign requests,
    certificate revocation lists etc.

    All data is saved in an encrypted, portable database, and can be exported
    in various standard formats. XCA is also available for MacOS X and
    Windows systems.

    For a good workflow, certificate templates can be defined to make the
    creation of new certificates an easy task.
