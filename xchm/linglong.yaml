    Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file viewer for X
    xCHM is a viewer for Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files. It can show the contents
    tree if one is available, print the current page and do the usual history
    stunts. It allows one to change fonts and search for text in all the pages of
    the file, or in the page's titles.

    xCHM does not support JavaScript in books.
