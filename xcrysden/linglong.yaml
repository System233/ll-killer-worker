    Crystalline and Molecular Structure Visualizer
    XCrySDen is a crystalline and molecular structure visualisation
    program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can
    be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated
    and manipulated. It can run on most UNIX platforms, without any
    special hardware requirements.

    XCrySDen allows for real-time capture of display. Several movie encoders
    are supported, in particular for Animated-GIF convert (imagemagick),
    gifsicle, or whirlgif are necessary. For AVI/MPEG mencoder or
    ppmtompeg (netpbm) is required. For window dumps either imagemagick or
    xwd (x11-apps) needs to be present.
