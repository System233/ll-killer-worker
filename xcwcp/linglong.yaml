    Morse code tutor - graphical user interface
    The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse code.

    This package provides an interactive Morse code tutor with a Qt4
    user interface. It allows choosing from a number of options for
    practice, including sending random characters, random words, and
    characters from the keyboard. It will also receive Morse code sent
    using the keyboard or mouse as a Morse keyer, and display the
    characters it sees.
