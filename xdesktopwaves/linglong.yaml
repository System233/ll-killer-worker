    Simulation of water waves on the X Window System
    xdesktopwaves is a cellular automata setting the background of your
    X Window System under water. Windows and mouse are like ships on
    the sea. Each movement of these ends up in moving water waves. You
    can even have rain and/or storm stirring up the water.
