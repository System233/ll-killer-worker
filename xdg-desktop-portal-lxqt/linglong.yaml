    xdg-desktop-portal using Qt/KF5/libfm-qt
    LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
    technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and
    an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, LXQt also works
    fine with less powerful machines.

    This package contains a backend implementation for xdg-desktop-portal that is
    using Qt/KF5/libfm-qt.
