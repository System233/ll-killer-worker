  description: |-
    Chemical structures and reactions editor
    Xdrawchem is a 2D editor for chemical structures and reactions.  It
    mirrors the abilities of the commercial ChemDraw suite and has file
    compatibility with it as well as other chemical formats through
    OpenBabel.

    This packaged version comes from a fork available at
    https://gitlab.com/yamanq/xdrawchem, as the previous version was no
    longer actively maintained. More information about it in the copyright
    file.
