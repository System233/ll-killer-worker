    clipboard history utility
    Clipman enables you to store and recall X selections, as well as GTK+
    clipboard content. You can also define actions to be triggered by selecting
    some text pattern.

    This package uses Xfce libraries but can be used without the Xfce panel
    and only requires a system tray (notification area).
