    graphical application for managing Xfce settings
    xfce4-settings is the Xfce settings manager front-end. It comes
    with several different components for configuring application-independent
    settings inside xfconf.
    It contains multiple tools:
    - xfce4-settings-manager (which replaces the old mcs settings manager),
    which executes the various (provided) settings dialogs
    - xfce4-settings-editor, a tool for editing ALL settings within xfconf, the
    graphical counterpart of xfconf-query.
    - xfsettingsd, a daemon for exporting XSettings to applications, and
    providing special features like keyboard shortcuts, AccessX notification
    and update of keyboard and mouse-pointer data.
