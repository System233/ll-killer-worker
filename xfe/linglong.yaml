    lightweight file manager for X11
    Xfe is based on the popular but discontinued X Win Commander. It is
    desktop independent and is written using the C++ Fox Toolkit. Its
    appearance is similar to the Windows file-manager Total Commander
    or Windows Explorer. It is very fast and simple.

    The main features are: file associations, mount/umount devices,
    directory tree for quick cd, change file attributes, auto save
    registry, compressed archives view/creation/extraction, compatibility
    with GNOME/KDE/Xfce, and much more.

    Containing a simple text editor (Xfwrite), image viewer (Xfimage) and
    package manager (Xfpack).
