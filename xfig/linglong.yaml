    Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11
    XFig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and
    manipulate objects interactively in an X window.  The resulting
    pictures can be saved.  If the fig2dev program is installed, which is
    contained in the fig2dev package, the pictures can be printed on
    postscript printers or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g.
    to allow inclusion in LaTeX documents or web pages).

    This package contains the xfig program itself.

    You should think about installing the fig2dev package to export the
    graphics to several common formats.  You should also think about
    installing xfig-doc, which contains the documentation and xfig-libs,
    which contains several clip art libraries.
