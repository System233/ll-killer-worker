    window manager of the Xfce project
    This package contains xfwm4 which is the window manager for Xfce4.  It is
    designed to run with the rest of Xfce4 but makes a capable window manager
    for GNOME or KDE.

    Install xfwm4 if you want a small, resource saving window manager which
    complies to the standards defined at http://www.freedesktop.org/. Without
    xfce4 installed this only gives you a window manager not the full
    environment.
