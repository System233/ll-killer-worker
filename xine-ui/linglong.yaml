    xine video player, graphical user interface
    This is an X11 based GUI for the libxine video player library.
    It provides xine, a skin based media player that can play all the
    audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this includes MPEG1/2,
    some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based
    media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found on
    http://xinehq.de/index.php/features/.

    Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
    System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs,
    because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at
    /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information!
