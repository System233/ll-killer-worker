    environment for Bible reading, study, and research
    Xiphos is a Bible study program for the GNOME desktop environment, based on The
    SWORD Project by the CrossWire Bible Society, a framework for developing Bible
    study tools and of associated texts such as commentaries and dictionaries.

    This package provides the main Xiphos program, a digital text reader with
    bookmarks and full-text search. It allows viewing multiple versions of the same
    text, for parallel reading of alternatives or translations. It also supports
    personal verse-specific notes and a rich-text study pad, both of which have
    spell checking and full-text search.

    Xiphos has a built-in facility to browse and install freely-distributed content
    from CrossWire repositories.
