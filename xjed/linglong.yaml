    editor for programmers (x11 version)
    Jed is a small, fast (faster startup than xterm with bash),
    and powerful text editor.

    Completely customizable with prepared emulation modes for Emacs, CUA
    (similar to KDE/Gnome/Openoffice), Borland-IDE, Brief, and EDT. Extensible
    in the S-Lang scripting language (with a syntax resembling C).

    Editing functions: folding support; rectangular cut/paste; regular
    expression search/replace; incremental searches; search/replace across
    multiple files; multiple windows; multiple buffers; ...

    Special modes (syntax highlight, indention, compile, ...) for
    Basic, C, C++, DCL, FORTRAN, IDL, Java, NROFF, Pascal,
    Perl, PHP, PostScript, Python, SH.
    Modes for markup languages include HTML and (La)TeX (with AUC-TeX style
    editing and BibTeX)

    Tools: directory editor (dired); info (browse GNU info files); mail;
    rmail; ispell; shell mode; ...

    The native X11 version provides improved mouse support, key configuration
    and X selection interaction. If no display is available, xjed falls back to
    text mode, thus there is no need to install both jed and xjed packages.

    Additional tools and modes can be found in the jed-extra package.
