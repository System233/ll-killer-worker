    manipulate X11 keymaps (for xmodmap) graphically
    xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap(1). It opens a window that looks
    like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier
    bits that key generates. Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease
    events on the window of your choice. It is possible to change the KeySyms
    and Modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface. This
    program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in
    future sessions.
