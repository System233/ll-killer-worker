    GTK+ Logging program for Hamradio Operators
    xlog is a logging program for amateur radio operators which can be used
    for daily logging and contest. Logs are stored into a text file.

    QSO's are presented in a list. Items in the list can be added, deleted or
    updated. For each contact, dxcc information is displayed and bearings and
    distance is calculated, both short and long path.

    When hamlib is enabled through the menu, you can retrieve frequency, mode and
    signal-strength from your rig over the serial port.
