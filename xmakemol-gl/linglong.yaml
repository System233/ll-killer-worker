    program for visualizing atomic and molecular systems (OpenGL)
    XMakemol is a mouse-based program, written using the LessTif widget set, for
    viewing and manipulating atomic and other chemical systems.  It reads XYZ
    input and renders atoms, bonds and hydrogen bonds.

    Features include:
    - Animating multiple frame files
    - Interactive measurement of bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles
    - Control over atom/bond sizes
    - Exporting to Xpm, Encapsulated PostScript and XYZ formats
    - Toggling the visibility of groups of atoms
    - Editing the positions of subsets of atoms

    This is the OpenGL-enabled XMakemol package. The images are rendered using
    true 3D graphics primitives, and can be exported using the Xpm format;
    red/blue stereo images can also be produced. The OpenGL package provides more
    display options, along with better support for displaying vectors. Ellipses
    can also be rendered.
