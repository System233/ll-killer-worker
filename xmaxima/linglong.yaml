    Maxima is a fully symbolic computation program.  It is full featured
    doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
    functions, integration, Todd-coxeter methods for finite group
    analysis, graphing, multiple precision floating point computation.
    It has a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
    based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970s.  It is
    quite reliable, and has good garbage collection, and no memory leaks.
