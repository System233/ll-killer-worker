  description: |-
    Multiprecision polynomial solver (graphical version)
    A polynomial rootfinder that can determine arbitrary precision approximations
    with guaranteed inclusion radii.
    It supports exploiting of polynomial structures such as sparsisty and allows
    for polynomial implicitly defined or in some non standard basis.

    This package contains the graphical version of MPSolve.
