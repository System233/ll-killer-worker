    Motif-based PDF reader using the Poppler library
    xpdf is a light-weight open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
    files (also called 'Adobe Acrobat' or 'Acrobat' files).  This is just the
    xpdf viewer client; various command-line pdf tools are now provided via the
    poppler-utils package.

    Debian's xpdf is a fork of Xpdf version 3, modified to use the Poppler
    PDF rendering library but keeping the Motif toolkit, and nowadays maintained
    as the xpopple project.
