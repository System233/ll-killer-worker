    tool to detach/reattach running X programs
    Xpra gives you the functionality of GNU Screen for X applications.

    It allows the user to view remote X applications on their local machine, and
    disconnect and reconnect from the remote machine without losing the state of
    the running applications.

    Unlike VNC, these applications are "rootless".  They appear as individual
    windows inside your window manager rather than being contained within a single
    window.
