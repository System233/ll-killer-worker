    featureful graphical frontend for SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
    xsane can be run as a stand-alone program or through the GIMP image
    manipulation program.  In stand-alone mode, xsane can save an image
    to a file in a variety of image formats, serve as a frontend to a
    fax program, or send an image to a printer.

    SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
    programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
    raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
    video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
    free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
    current source code is written to support several operating systems,
    including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
    under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
    backends are welcome, too, however).
