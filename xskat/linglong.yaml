    3-player card game "Skat"
    Xskat lets you play the card game Skat as defined by the official
    German "Skatordnung".

    You can play by sending a window to the other player's X display, or
    via an IRC server. The computer can also simulate players.

    Many unofficial rules like "Ramsch" or "Bock" are supported.
