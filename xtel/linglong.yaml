    X emulator of the French Minitel
    This is a lesstif Minitel client that runs on color/black and white
    X Display and a xteld daemon that can make Minitel connection with
    one or more modems.

    The Minitel is a dedicated terminal for accessing the Teletel,
    the French videotex network.
    Thus, this package is almost only for French users.
    This package now supports the 3622 I-Minitel protocol
    (more information on http://www.i-minitel.com).
