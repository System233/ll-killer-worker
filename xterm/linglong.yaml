    X terminal emulator
    xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
    and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
    window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
    the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.

    This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
    terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
    intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
    character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the luit
    package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
    KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
    previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.

    A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
    is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.

    The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.

    Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
    xfonts-cyrillic package as well.
