    CAD program for designing model railroad layouts
    With XTrackCAD you can:
    Design layouts in any scale and gauge
    Use the predefined libraries for many popular brands of turnouts to
    help you get started easily
    Add your own favorite components
    Manipulate track much like you would with actual flex-track to modify
    extend and join tracks and turnouts
    Test your design by running trains, including picking them up and moving
    them with the mouse.
    At any point you can print the design in a scale of your choice. When
    printed in 1:1 scale the printout can be used as a template for laying
    the track to build your dream layout.
    Learning XTrackCAD is made easy with the extensive on-line help and
    demonstrations.
