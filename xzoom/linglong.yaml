    magnify part of X display, with real-time updates
    Like xmag, xzoom magnifies a section of the X display. Xzoom is different
    because it will continuously update the magnified area as the display
    changes. It is fast enough to enlarge small animations, for example.

    It can also mirror or rotate a part of the screen.
