    Quake-style terminal emulator based on KDE Konsole technology
    YaKuake is inspired from the terminal in the Quake game: when you press a key
    (by default F12, but that can be changed) a terminal window slides down from
    the top of the screen. Press the key again, and the terminal slides back.

    It is faster than a keyboard shortcut because it is already loaded into memory
    and as such is very useful to anyone who frequently finds themselves switching
    in and out of terminal sessions.
