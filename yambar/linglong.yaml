    Lightweight and configurable status panel
    yambar is a lightweight and configurable status panel (bar, for short) for X11
    and Wayland, that goes to great lengths to be both CPU and battery efficient -
    polling is only done when absolutely necessary.

    It has a number of modules that provide information in the form of tags. For
    example, the clock module has a date tag that contains the current date.

    The modules do not know how to present the information though. This is instead
    done by particles. And the user, you, decides which particles (and thus how to
    present the data) to use.

    Furthermore, each particle can have a decoration - a background color or a
    graphical underline, for example.

    There is no support for images or icons. use an icon font (e.g. Font Awesome,
    or Material Icons) if you want a graphical representation.

    There are a number of modules and particles builtin. More can be added as
    plugins. You can even write your own!

    To summarize: a bar displays information provided by modules, using particles
    and decorations. How is configured by you.
