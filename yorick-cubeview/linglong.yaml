    3D FITS data viewer specialized in spectro-imaging
    Cubeview is a viewer for 3D data store in FITS files, a file format
    extensively used among astronomers. It is specialized in displaying
    spectro-imaging data but can be used to do basic visualization on any
    FITS file containing a 3D array.

    Cubeview features a stand-alone graphical user interface which
    adheres to the GTK+ look-and-feel. Being written in
    Yorick, it is inherently scriptable. A system of hooks allows custom
    actions to be repeated automatically when certain events occur.
