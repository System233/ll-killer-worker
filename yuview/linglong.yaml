    QT based YUV player with an advanced analytic toolset
    YUView is a YUV image player and analysis tool.
    However, it can do so much more:
    * simple navigation/zooming in the video
    * support for a wide variety of YUV formats using various subsamplings
    and bit depts
    * support for raw RGB files, image files and image sequences
    * direct decoding of raw h.265/HEVC bitstreams with visualization of
    internals like prediction modes and motion vectors and many more
    * interface with visualization for the reference software decoders HM
    and JEM
    * support for opening almost any file using FFmpeg
    * image comparison using side-by-side and comparison view
    * calculation and display of differences (in YUV or RGB colorspace)
    * save and load playlists
    * overlay the video with statistics data

    Note: YUV is kind of RAW image format stored by color spaces. Y stands
    for luminance component, so it's in black-and-white, while UV are
    chromatic parts of the image.
