    document viewer with a minimalistic interface
    zathura is a document viewer for PDF and other formats with a minimalistic and
    space saving interface. It offers a vim-like experience and has a focus on
    keyboard interaction. The key bindings, commands and most other settings can
    be customized.

    Some of the features are:
    * bookmarking pages
    * printing the whole document or specific pages
    * following links
    * searching in the document
    * browsing the document index
    * SyncTex forward and backward synchronization

    zathura can be extended to support other file formats via a plugin system.
