    arcade action puzzle game
    Zaz is an arcade action puzzle game where the goal is to get rid of
    all incoming balls by rearranging their order and making triplets.
    It currently includes 12 different levels. The game's name is recursive
    and stands for "Zaz ain't Z".

    A 3D accelerator is needed for decent gameplay.
