    Simple offline API documentation browser
    Zeal is a simple offline API documentation browser inspired by Dash (OS X
    app), available for Linux and Windows.

    * Quickly search documentation using Alt+Space (or customised) hotkey to
    display Zeal from any place in your workspace.
    * Search in multiple sets of documentation at once.
    * Don't be dependent on your internet connection.
    * Integrate Zeal with Emacs, Sublime Text, or Vim.
