    graphical text editor based on wiki technologies
    Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages.

    Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and inline
    images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can
    have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent
    page.

    All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various
    plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an
    equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.

    Zim can be used to:
    * Keep an archive of notes
    * Take notes during meetings or lectures
    * Organize task lists
    * Draft blog entries and emails
    * Do brainstorming
