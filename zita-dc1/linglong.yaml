    Dynamics Compressor
    Dynamic range compression reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet
    sounds thus reducing or compressing an audio signal's dynamic range. DC1
    provides a dynamics compressor for use with JACK Audio Connection Kit. It can
    be used as master effect or as an effect on individual instrument tracks as
    well.
