    pro-audio reverb effect
    REV1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for Aeolus.
    Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used on a wide
    variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser - the early
    reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not correspond
    to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and right sources to
    some extent.

    In Stereo mode a dry/wet mix control is provided, so it can be used either
    as an insert or in send/return mode. For mono just connect one of the
    two channels.

    In Ambisonic mode (selected by the -B command line option) the only option
    is the send/return mode.
