    Efficient full-featured X11 terminal emulator
    Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
    similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and
    others. It is also similar to other, much more modern, GPU-accelerated
    terminal emulators.

    Zutty uses a radically simple, yet extremely efficient rendering
    implementation, coupled with a sufficiently complete feature set to
    make it useful for a wide range of users. It also offers high
    throughput with low latency, and strives to conform to relevant
    standards, either published or de-facto.

    Notice this program requires your GPU OpenGL to support compute,
    fragment and vertex shaders, otherwise it will fail to start.
